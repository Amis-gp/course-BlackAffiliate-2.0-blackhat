# Build Your First Business Manager Setup

1. Log in to an available Facebook account
2. Create a Fan Page, fill it out
3. Go to Facebook Ads Manager.
    - Explore the dashboard and familiarize yourself with key sections (Campaigns, Ad Sets, and Ads).
4. Create a simple mock ad campaign (it doesn’t have to be published, just set up for learning purposes).
    - Set the objective to leads (you can use a random link for now).

5.  Choose an offer, an affiliate network

Go to their website and explore the different offers available. Don’t sign up yet—just familiarize yourself with the layout, categories, and how offers are displayed.

Make a list of three offers that interest you. Write a brief note (1-2 sentences) about why you think each offer could work for traffic arbitrage.
