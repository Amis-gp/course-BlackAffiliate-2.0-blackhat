# Tracking: The Backbone of Traffic Arbitrage

![Tracking Overview](/img/1.6/image1.webp)

## Tracking Meets Cloaking: A Winning Strategy

When you're navigating the tricky waters of Facebook ad moderation, cloaking is often a go-to tactic. Tracking makes cloaking seamless and effective. Tools like Keitaro let you split traffic intelligently:

* **White Pages for Moderators**: Send bots and ad reviewers to compliant landing pages that pass scrutiny.  
* **Money Pages for Users**: Direct real users to your high-converting offer pages.

Tracking ensures your cloaking setup is working correctly by monitoring which traffic goes where. You'll also get detailed metrics like click-through rates (CTR), conversion rates (CR), and earnings per click (EPC), helping you fine-tune your campaigns for maximum ROI.

## Key Benefits of Using a Tracker

Here's how a tracker empowers you to dominate your campaigns:

* **Track Every Click**: Know exactly where your traffic originates and how users interact with your funnel.  
* **Segment Your Audience**: Break down users by geolocation, device type, browser, or OS to target more effectively.  
* **Run A/B Tests**: Test different creatives, landing pages, or offers to identify top performers.  
* **Optimize for Profit**: Pause low-performing campaigns and redirect budget to high-ROI offers.  
* **Bypass Ad Moderation**: Some trackers offer built-in cloaking or page-rotation features to help your ads slip through strict platform reviews while still delivering users to your real offers.

## Choosing the Right Tracker for Your Needs

Not all trackers are created equal. To pick the best one for your arbitrage campaigns, consider these factors:

## Hosting Type

* **Self-Hosted Trackers** (e.g., Keitaro): Installed on your own server, giving you full control and cost savings. Ideal for high-traffic campaigns but requires technical know-how to manage.  
* **Cloud-Based Trackers** (e.g., Voluum): Hosted by the provider, offering ease of use but higher costs. Cloud-based allows major players who spend very large sums on advertising to see uninterrupted analytics and handle large volumes of traffic.

## Traffic Volume

* For small to medium campaigns, cloud-based trackers are sufficient.  
* For high-volume traffic, self-hosted trackers offer better scalability and cost-efficiency.

## Affiliate Network Integration

Look for trackers with pre-built templates for popular affiliate networks. These streamline setup and minimize errors.

## WebView Compatibility

If you're running mobile app traffic, ensure your tracker supports WebView event tracking and postback setup to sync data with ad platforms and networks.
