# Important Notes

This lesson is important for understanding the basics of how proxies work, where to buy them if needed, and where to set them up.

If you're working with accounts from Fan Agency, the seller will most likely provide you, along with the account, access to an anti-detect browser and proxies that can be used to log in.

This seller also offers another way of granting access: they share access to their Business Manager by adding you to their BM so you can access the purchased account. In this case, you'll need another separate Facebook account to log in. Therefore, with this method, you might also need proxies.
