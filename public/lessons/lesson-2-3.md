# Working with Facebook Agency Accounts

In the dynamic world of traffic arbitrage, Facebook can sometimes feel like an unpredictable gatekeeper, ready to block your efforts at a moment’s notice. But there’s a way to make your work steady and effective—using agency accounts. In this lesson, we’ll explore why agency accounts, especially those from Fan Agency, are worth considering, how they can support your campaigns, and how to get started with them. Let’s dive in together\!


## 🌱 Why Agency Accounts Are a Smart Choice?

When running ads on Facebook, especially with gray or black hat offers, the risk of bans is always lurking. Agency accounts, like those offered by Fan Agency, can serve as a reliable ally. Here’s why they stand out:

* **Higher Trust**: These accounts carry a stronger reputation with Facebook, helping you navigate ban storms more smoothly.  
* **Flexibility**: They support a range of budgets—from $250 to unlimited limits—allowing you to tailor your campaign to your needs.  
* **Support**: Fan Agency provides access to a team ready to assist anytime, which is especially helpful for beginners.

One neat perk is that Fan Agency offers resources like free setup, testing, or even account replacement if needed. They also support all product types—from Black Hat to White Hat—and funds are transferred only after campaign verification. You can reach out to them via @funagency, where accounts are available for any country and time zone.


## 🎯 How Agency Accounts Impact Your Campaigns

Agency accounts aren’t just tools—they’re a way to make your work more comfortable. Here’s how they fit into arbitrage:

* **Scalability Potential**: You can start with small budgets and grow gradually without worrying about restrictions.  
* **Ban Resistance**: Thanks to their solid reputation, these accounts are less likely to face sanctions.  
* **Quick Recovery**: If an account gets blocked, Fan Agency can provide a replacement, keeping you on track.

Compared to cheap autogenerated accounts, which often cause headaches these days, agency accounts offer greater stability. They’re particularly valuable when you’re just starting out and want to avoid unnecessary hassle.


## 🛠️ How to Get Started with Fan Agency

Here are a few simple steps to integrate agency accounts into your workflow:

1. **Connect with the Team**: Reach out via @funagency to learn the details. They operate globally, so pick a time zone that suits you.  
2. **Choose an Account**: Start with one—say, with a $250 limit—and add more as your campaign expands.  
3. **Setup**: Take advantage of offered resources like free testing. If they provide Adspower, it’s fine, but you can also request an invitation to their Business Manager to link it with your King account.  
4. **Launch**: Once the campaign is verified, you’re ready to go without wasting extra time.


## 🔗 Integrating with Your King Account and Business Manager

Got a King account with a fan page and ad account? Here’s how it works with Fan Agency:

* Fan Agency uses its own Business Manager to host rented accounts. You’ll need an invitation from them to become a user and gain access.  
* If you want to connect their ad accounts to your own BM, it’s possible, but typically, access is provided through their BM.
