**Types of bans and restrictions.**

To begin with, let's understand what "sanctions" FB can impose on us. Globally, they can be divided into two categories:

- Checkpoints are restrictions that FB imposes on a social account. That is, these are various identity confirmations before passing which you can't use FB at all.
- Bans are restrictions on advertising tools. If they come, you can't use the advertising tool that is subject to the restriction.
.
**Types of checkpoints:**

- Selfies - Facebook's request for a photo of you to confirm your identity. After the request, you wait about a day and your page is either unblocked or banned. In most cases - the second.
- Confirm phone number - Facebook asks you to link your phone number or accept a message with a code (if the number is linked); As a rule, after passing this checkpoint, selfies fly right away.
- Enter account details - Facebook usually asks you to enter your birthday date, which is listed in the account. It may also ask you to select the last names of people in your photo friends.
- Passing 2FA - you need to enter a constantly updated code from the Google Authenticator app
- Requesting ID - Facebook asks for a photo ID.

If you don't pass the checkpoint, you get your social account deactivated. You won't be able can't use it anymore.

## Types of bans:

- Advertising account ban (both personal and BM account) - you can't use only this advertising account

**Passing checkpoints.**
.
### Selfies:

1. Go to [this-person-does-not-exist.com](https://this-person-does-not-exist.com/en), enter gender, age and click "Refresh Image":
![image](/img/2.5/image2.jpg)

2. Next, take a screenshot of the resulting photo and upload it to FB (so that you don't see the watermark in the corner):
![image](/img/2.5/image3.jpg)

- **Phone number confirmation**

It's simple here. If you have a number bound to which you have access - accept SMS. If no number is tied, tie a number with [sms-activate.org](https://sms-activate.org/ru). If it's not your number - forget about the account. There is nothing you can do here. Less often, but sometimes there is a request for confirmation by mail. Go through the same methods, only the code is received not to the number, but to email.

- **Enter account data**

The method of passing depends on the requested data, as a rule, it is usually possible to pass only the date of birth. Sometimes it is written in the file with the data from the account, but in most cases it is ostuvetsya.

You can reinsure yourself and look for this date yourself in your account:

1. Go to the FB home page and click on the avatar and account name on the left:
![image](/img/2.5/image4.jpg)

2. On the page that opens, look for "information" and click on it:
![image](/img/2.5/image5.jpg)

3. On the left, select "Contact and Basic Information" and in this section you will find your date of birth:
![image](/img/2.5/image6.jpg)

You can do it the first thing you do when you log into your account and write this data down somewhere. But now this check rarely flies, so I don't bother.
.
## Passing 2FA

This check looks like this:
![image](/img/2.5/image7.jpg)

1. You need to download the "Google Authenticator" application for your phone (look for yourself under your OS).
2. Go to it, click on the plus sign in the lower right corner:
![image](/img/2.5/image8.jpg)
3. Select "Enter Setup Key":
![image](/img/2.5/image9.jpg)
4. In the column "Account" enter what you want, the main thing that you understood it was, and in the column "Key" enter the code 2FA, which was in the file with the account and click "Add":
![image](/img/2.5/image10.jpg)

This is what it looks like in the account text file:
![image](/img/2.5/image11.jpg)

Usually 2FA code is written before cookies (before square brackets) or before user agent. It is a set of 32 characters (letters and numbers). It looks like this: 5PP7 K633 DBA6 O7L6 7QZY KTZI MMD2 JYHO

5. Once added, your profile will appear in the list. There will be a code that you need to enter into this box on the FB side:
![image](/img/2.5/image12.jpg)

- **Document request**

This type of checkpoint is passed in the same way as the RD, we will deal with it below.
.
## Establishing the reason for the ban.

Bans will be 100%, so morally prepare for it. The only question is how often. Bans can be divided into 2 categories:

- Bans for suspicious activity
- Bans for advertising.

## Bans for suspicious activity.

Fly mainly when you try to do too many actions related to advertising.
Such actions include:

- Duplicate ad groups.
- Creating a large number of ads from the start (more than 3, but ideally not more than 1 to create).

So try to exclude these actions. But if it doesn't save you, it's better to test one ad at a time. Nowadays, for such actions you can get a confirmation of identity (PL) or an ZRD - they are passed in the same way.

## ZRD - ban on advertising activity.

On the account looks like this:
![image](/img/2.5/image13.jpg)

The essence of this type of ban is that we are not allowed to use any Facebook advertising tools until we prove our identity.

**Identity is confirmed by uploading documents.**

There are several options for where to get the documents (arranged in the order in which to try):

1. Dump your own.
2. Rework from the template I provided for the course.
3. Make one on a generator: [docgen.nppr.team](https://docgen.nppr.team/).

Fill in the fields in the generator as follows:
if you configure the generator according to the given parameters, you will pass about 70%
on the settings:

- Take the first and last name from your account
- in English
- photo with background
- do not display horizontally
- add a caption
- without a serial number (this is important because it does not work with a number)
- with the flag of the country
- add noise

In general, the passability of documents for ZRD accounts is a rather random thing. Sometimes documents from the generator with random data filled in from scratch, and sometimes on a real account, when sending documents of a real person (account owner), the account is not unlocked because "identity cannot be confirmed".

Important! A large number of rejected ads or banned ad accounts can also be charged ZRD. What to do if you have been banned from an advertising account. If we have been banned for advertising, we will see this warning when we open Ads Manager:
![image](/img/2.5/image14.jpg)

The order of actions is fixed and as soon as the ban arrived you must: Send a request for unblocking + Check the domain for ban + Uniqueize the creative. Below we will understand how it is done. Submit an unlock request.

I advise you to always send an unlock request, as it takes a minute, but it can potentially bring your account back to life. But to be fair, I note that accounts are not often released (depends on the reason for the ban).

1. First you need to go to Account Quality and see which object has restrictions on it and click on it:
![image](/img/2.5/image15.jpg)

2. When you click on the social acc or BM, you will be taken to a page where you can see the status of the social or BM and send a request for their unban (usually there is a confirmation of identity):
![image](/img/2.5/image16.jpg)

If there is a confirmation of identity, you may be asked for a phone number, selfies or documents. How to go through this was discussed above.

3. Also below we can see the statuses of advertising accounts and FP:
![image](/img/2.5/image17.jpg)

4. Clicking on an advertising account/FP with restrictions will take you to the same page where you can submit a request:
![image](/img/2.5/image18.jpg)

**Important!** The button in the marked place may be absent if there is no possibility to submit an unlock request. Or it may be inactive if there are some other restrictions on the account (when hovering over the button, it will be written in detail what kind of restrictions)

Also, as an account at the advertising cabinet level you can send a request to reconsider a rejected ad.

To do this: Check the checkbox on the ad that was rejected and click "Request reconsideration". After that it goes to the folder "On check", you wait for what decision will be made by FB, it can both activate the ad (unscrew immediately begins), and reject it again:
![image](/img/2.5/image19.jpg)

## Creative Uniqueization.

Uniqueization comes in many forms:
- Programmatic
- Content

**1) Programmatic uniqueization.**
A type of uniqueization that does not change the content of the creative. It just changes the hash sum of the creative, may impose noise, slightly change the contrast and angle of the picture.
Such uniqueization should be done before each launch of the link (preferably, even if before this creative did not pour).

**Domain Validation How to do:**

1. For this we need to go to the website: [Domain Validation Link](https://developers.facebook.com/tools/debug/).
2. On the site, enter your link and click "Debug".
3. The most important thing is that we do not display this message:
![image](/img/2.5/image20.jpg)

If this error is not present, but there is some other error like og: image - it is not terrible, it does not affect the work. But if you get the error from the screen above, or a message about forbidden content - you need to change the domain. After the change, check the link again in the debugger. If the error persists, then the matter may be in the same way in White.

Parsing the most common reasons for banning an advertising account. At this stage we need to understand what provoked the ban. To do this we need to install the [MaskFB plugin](https://maskfb.ru/) (if you do not have it installed yet).
To do this:

1. On the left side of Dolphin, select "extensions":
![image](/img/2.5/image21.jpg)

2. In the window that opens, click on the plus sign:
![image](/img/2.5/image22.jpg)

3. and then select everything as shown in the screenshot:
![image](/img/2.5/image23.jpg)

If you have AdsPower, you can simply follow this link [https://maskfb.ru/](https://maskfb.ru/) in the open browser profile and install the plugin.

To work with it is simple, open Ads Manager and click on the icon, there you will see a window:
![image](/img/2.5/image24.jpg)

The information from this window can be divided into 4 columns (as I numbered from below).
So the content of the columns from left to right:

1. **column.** The name of the advertising account is written in white font and the reason for banning the advertising account is written in red font (if the account is not banned, the status will be Active).
2. **column.** Cost limit per day on the advertising account; Preview of the creative and its name; Current billing threshold on the account.
3. **column.** Ad status (Active - active; paused; disapproved rejected; pending_review).
4. **column.** Can be empty. It will be filled only if some announcement was rejected. In this case, it will contain the reason why the ad was rejected.

We are most interested in columns 1 and 4.

I would divide all advertising account bans into two categories:
- Bans for technicality (when there is no content in the ad that directly violates the rules)
- Bans for content (when FB saw content in the ad that violates the rules)

**Bans for technical component**

1. **Policy after a little spenda.**
![image](/img/2.5/image25.jpg)

The most common reason for banning on gray and black verticals. Here you need to look at the 4th column - is there an explanation there? If there is, then make decisions based on what is written there (sometimes the reason for the ban is directly written there).

If there is nothing there, then, most likely, the ban came from the start or after a small spin.

When such a ban comes, in the absolute majority of cases, it is related to the creative we launched.

2. **Systems for bypassing security features (OSB).**
![image](/img/2.5/image26.jpg)

First of all, write to appeal, now often flies this reason of ban "for nothing". At the moment, 9 of the 10 ackeys I have on moderation go to the rejection for this reason and after the request, all go out

The point above is relevant now, but there are other reasons for this rejection/ban.

As FB itself in the help writes - such a reason for the ban means that FB burned the connection with other accounts (if they were. It might not even be your accts, but just other people's accts with similar creos).

That is, it usually comes if you don't like something in the tech, creo or wyte.

In tech it's usually:

- Same IP on different accts (change proxies)
- One and the same creo launched on a personal, which received a ban, and then run on the BM (or in general on other accounts within the same social acc), without uniqueization (uniqueize first programmatically, if not helped - content).

**In creo it could be:**

- Arrows
- Blurred elements
- Emojis covering the text
- Sometimes just a visual that has been used frequently by other arbitrageurs can be the cause

**White:**
- Usually flies just when often used (that's why I advise 1 offer - 1 wight, although recently FB does not swear on wights very often)

3. **unacceptable business models (NBM).**
![image](/img/2.5/image27.jpg)

They come out for the following reasons (arranged in descending order of frequency):

- The white page has been used many times (if you are uploading without cloake) - change the white page or take a different landing page.
- Creative
- Domain (most likely here just through the FB domain to trace the connection that white/land was used) - change the domain

**4. Risk Piment**
![image](/img/2.5/image28.jpg)

Flies as a rule because of used card bins (first 6 digits) and low quality acks. But it happens that flies and on expensive sets, so there are no clear actions to prevent this variant of the ban.
Immediately note that the risk is of two types:

- Risk by form
- Prescheduling.

1) **Risk by form** - in this case FB will ask you to fill out the following form:
![image](/img/2.5/image29.jpg)

Here you can write that you have moved recently and specify the last 4 digits of the card number. As a photo you can attach a screenshot from your payment cabinet, where you can see the last transactions.

But I'll be honest, my review almost never ends with an unban, plus it takes a long time. That's why I don't pass it.

2) **Pre-scheduling** - FB will deduct the billing amount from your card to make sure you don't screw him. Typically, the pre-schedule is returned to your card after 3-7 days.

The process is simple, go to billing, payment settings and click on the "Approve" button:
![image](/img/2.5/image30.jpg)

In the pop-up window will pop up a reconfirmation - you approve and should pop up such a window that everything is successful:
![image](/img/2.5/image31.jpg)

If suddenly FB could not write off the pre-schedule (and in general if some bill does not pass), the reasons may be the following:

- There are not enough funds on the card (see your billing threshold or debt).
- Problems on the side of the payment service. Write to the support, sometimes it happens when you have a large number of transactions in the status pending, the service just does not let new ones until the previous ones pass.
- FB is glitching. This also happens not rarely. Try to reduce the budget on the group of ads to 3 bucks and pass the pre-schedule again. If it passed - return the required budget. If not - take another account.

The main disadvantage of pre-scheduling - you "freeze" turnover.

5. **Unsetteled debt (Unsetteled)**
![image](/img/2.5/image32.jpg)

With this type of ban, the status of the ad campaign changes from "Active" to "Account Error":
![image](/img/2.5/image33.jpg)

To pass you just need to go to billing, payment settings and pay the debt and then the ads will resume showing:
![image](/img/2.5/image34.jpg)

**Ban for content.**

It's much simpler than that. If FB sees banned content in our ads, the 4th column will say what kind of content it is, for example, "Adult Products and Services" or "Personal Health and Appearance":
![image](/img/2.5/image35.jpg)

That is, your task is to understand what FB doesn't like, find where this moment is present in your bundle and either remove it or redo it so that FB can't recognize the forbidden.

**How to find a 100% reason to go bananas.**

Everything I wrote above works in most cases, but not 100%. Causes and solutions are still categorized as probabilistic.

If you have tried changing the variables that I wrote above, but the bans continue, I advise you to use the scheme that I give below.

To find the exact problematic part that is causing the bans, we need to first find the global variable. Global variables are:

- Account
- Creative
- Link

**Why are these global variables?**
Because once we've figured out which global variable causes everything to go to ban, it's broken down into smaller variables:

**Account:**
- IP
- Antidetect/iron from which it was registered/logged in.
- Pre-pharmacy behavior

(in our case, if the cause of bans will be the account - we just change the seller)

**Creative:**
- Content of the creative (what specific objects are placed in the image).
- Technical parameters of the creative (meta data and hash sum - must always be unique).

**Link:**
- Server IP
- Domain
- Land/preland/white content

That is, globally, there are only two options why the FB account gets banned:

1. FB something does not like in our bundle: creo, link
2. ban for the quality of the account, that is, it is weak.

And here our task is to find a global variable on which FB swears. To do this is quite simple:

Take an account in the same shop that you took, and pour on it advertising with a link yandex.ru and neutral creo (for example, just a picture of a cat or a house). If it passes, then, most likely, the problem was in the creo or in the link (or both). If it doesn't go through - most likely the issue was with the accts and I would start by changing the shop/type of accts.

Take our creative and pour it with a link yandex.ru - if it passes moderation, then the case was in the link and further it will be distributed on smaller variables. If it does not pass, go to point 3.

Again we take a picture of something as neutral as possible (a cat or a picture of the house) and pour our link. If the ad passes moderation - it was in the creo.

In 90% of cases, you will find the reason. After you have found it, you split the global variable into smaller variables (which ones - gave above) and test them. Just figure out for yourself what FB is more likely to cuss at.
