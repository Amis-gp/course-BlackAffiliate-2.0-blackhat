# Passing the Advertising Activity Ban

ZRD (Advertising Activity Ban) is an integral part of traffic arbitrage. It plays a crucial role in maintaining the security of advertising accounts. We offer detailed information on how to pass the ZRD in light of the latest changes and protect your account, avoiding its blockage.

A ban on advertising activity is essentially equivalent to an account block. For those engaged in traffic arbitrage, it can become a major headache. The restrictions imposed by Facebook on an advertising account prevent advertising on this platform. Up to 99% of arbitrage marketers face this issue, especially during the account creation stage, as the overwhelming majority encounter ZRD during the upload phase. This is a serious problem that hampers the scaling of a successful campaign and often halts the uploading process altogether. That’s why experienced specialists often intentionally trigger an Advertising Activity Ban—this allows them to continue working without worrying about potential restrictions.

## Factors affecting the ZRD:

* A large number of accounts accessed from a single device. If Facebook suspects this behavior, they may assume a violation of rules.  
* Low spending limit until the card is linked.  
* Gradual increase of the campaign budget.  
* Regular IP address changes.  
* Linking a bank card and account with conflicting data.  
* Suspicious activity after account login.  
* Multi-accounting (linking two advertising accounts to one Facebook account).  
* Systematic updates of personal information in the profile.

For verification of users who fall under the Advertising Activity Ban, the platform employs various methods, including:

* Selfies: Sometimes, Facebook requests a selfie with an ID to verify that the account owner is a real person.  
* Document photos: Facebook reserves the right to request a photo of an identification document to confirm identity.  
* Friend list verification, conducted as part of additional verification.

Today, Facebook has millions of users around the world, and the above-mentioned checks are carried out by bots. If there is any doubt about the authenticity of an account, the documents are forwarded for manual authentication by security staff.

## Key Aspects of Passing Facebook Verification

*Identity Verification via Selfie*

In the case of ZRD, this option is rarely used; it is typically employed to restore access to a user's pages. However, if the platform requests a selfie, follow these rules:

* One close-up of your face.  
* Photo format – JPEG or PNG, with a maximum size of 2 MB.  
* Clear facial features without blurring or shadows. Do not take the photo wearing sunglasses or a hat.

## Verification via Document Photos

This method is frequently used during the ZRD process, so let’s go over it in more detail:

1. Go to your Facebook account and open the Account Quality section.  
2. Click on "Request a Review."  
3. Upload a photo of your documents.

If the account does not have a linked email or if the email is unverified, you will likely need to confirm it by entering a code sent to your email. To avoid issues at this stage, make sure you are logged into the correct email beforehand.

In some cases, you may need to pass additional verification via SMS, so ensure you have access to services that can receive messages.

Once all steps are completed, upload the photo. You can find suitable document images online or create them manually using basic editing tools. Acceptable documents include either a passport or a driver’s license.

Before uploading, it is crucial to remove metadata from the image. Otherwise, Facebook's algorithm may detect that the image already exists on the internet and flag it as fake.

## Identity Verification via Friends List

This works as follows:  
Facebook will show photos of people from your friend list.

The task is to quickly identify who is shown in the photo—provide their first name and/or last name, as well as any other information about the person.

## How to Pass the Verification: Helpful Tips

Most often, when an advertising activity ban is applied, the platform uses document photo verification. This process can sometimes present challenges, so to ensure smooth identification, we recommend using the following tips:

* You can find documents with the relevant geo-location online—there are websites with templates specifically for passing ZRD. Once you select a suitable template, make changes to it using any editor.  
* You can also order document photos from specialized individuals who will create images with a high likelihood of passing the verification.

## Document Verification Before ZRD is Imposed

You can verify the correctness of your documents before your account is subjected to an advertising activity ban. This method involves authentication via the personal account and is used as follows:

1. Go to the link: [https://www.facebook.com/id/hub/](https://www.facebook.com/id/hub/)  
2. In the account settings, disable Facebook from saving documents (this will eliminate the risk of template overwriting).  
3. Select the reason for the ban (e.g., if the advertisement is related to political or public activities).  
4. Choose the geo-location (specify the country your ads will target).  
5. Enable two-factor authentication and select the document to upload.  
6. Wait for the verification. If you fail the verification, provide a different document.

Experienced arbitrage marketers recommend working with Asian geo-locations. It is believed that Facebook has trouble recognizing the faces of Koreans and Chinese people, so the chances of passing the verification are higher there.

## How to Build Trust with the Platform When Lifting ZRD

After successfully passing the verification, the platform will publish a notification in your profile stating that advertising activity is allowed. This is great because it means you can start running ads. However, how can you minimize the risk of being banned in the future?

1. To launch your campaigns, use Creative Hub instead of the classic Ads Manager.  
2. Change your anti-detect service and carefully check your proxy settings. It's better to use a unique IP pool for each Facebook account—this will help avoid attracting too much attention.  
3. Enable two-factor authentication—this will increase the reliability of your account in Facebook's eyes.  
4. Finally, consider self-triggering ZRD, which will allow you to assess how ready your account is for verification, thus reducing the chances of an unexpected ban.

## Detailed Guide on How to Trigger Verification:

1. Create an account in Facebook Ads Manager.  
2. Set a spending limit after linking your card.  
3. Launch a campaign using a Fan Page.  
4. Link a card with bad BINs and create a Business Manager (sometimes even a virtual card will suffice).

Usually, after completing these actions, you will receive a notification about the ZRD. Once this happens, you can begin the process of unlocking the account.  .
Successful completion of the ban does not guarantee that the platform won't ban your account again in the future. That’s why it’s crucial to maintain your account in good standing by following the tips provided above.
