# Ideal customer profile - Prompt

Today, I need your help as the Chief Marketing Analyst. I want you to create the ideal buyer persona for my product.

To achieve this, please perform the following actions:

1. First, read the information about my product, market, and avatar for context. You can find details about my product in the section "PRODUCT AND AUDIENCE INFORMATION."
2. Second, create a detailed ideal buyer profile. The information should be structured as follows:

### 1) Demographic Data

- Name
- Age
- Brief description

### 2) Core Problem

- The main problem they are facing
- 5 key emotions related to this problem
- Top 5 biggest fears
- 5 ways these fears affect close relationships
- 5 conversational but hurtful things relatives might say

### 3) Other Solutions

- What they have tried in the past (list 5-6 different solutions)
- Brief conversational snippets about what they have tried in the past
- What they don't want to do to solve their problem
- Brief conversational snippets about what they don't want to do

### 4) Transformation

- If a genie could snap their fingers and provide the perfect solution, what would the ideal life of my perfect customer look like?
- How will this affect their relationships with their spouse, children, friends, and colleagues?

### 5) Audience Specifics

- What determines the avatar's success in achieving the result?
- Who does the avatar blame for their problems?
- What are the top 5 most common objections the avatar has, which they believe prevent them from achieving the desired result?

### Here’s additional context for each section

Core Problem:

This is the central, dominant issue in their life. For example: chronic knee pain, inability to meet attractive women, feeling stuck in a rat race.

5 Fears:

Write down the deepest fears that the potential customer likely won’t admit out loud. Fears that keep them up at night.

How fears affect relationships:

Provide more SPECIFIC examples of how each of these fears will impact SPECIFIC relationships. Be vivid, descriptive, and emotional. How will these fears (if proven true) affect people around the potential client? Example: their husband, children, friends, and colleagues.

Hurtful things these people might say:

Continuing with this scenario, what SPECIFIC things might these people say to our potential customer? Things they might consider hurtful, whether they intended to say them or not.

Genie’s Solution:

Imagine our potential customer meets a genie who can create the perfect solution that truly solves the problem. In this ideal scenario, list 5 results the potential customers would want to achieve from this solution.

Things the potential customer doesn’t want to do:

In this ideal scenario, list 5 things the potential customer DOES NOT want to do in order to get all these amazing results. Be specific. Use fragments of the internal monologue of the potential customer. Make them realistic, conversational, and emotional.

How it will affect emotions, activities, relationships:

If the genie grants all these desires of our potential customer, how exactly will this affect their life? Remember, this is the dream scenario for our potential customer. The deepest fantasies. We are looking for the key emotional drivers that they would never admit to anyone else.

What determines the avatar’s success:

Many avatars believe they need to reach a certain state to achieve a particular result. For example, experts might think they need more booked meetings. Copywriters might think they need to earn $10,000 per month. Their emotional satisfaction depends on this state.

What the avatar will have to give up:

Please dig deeper into the psychological layers of the human mind. People often derive some satisfaction from their problem, even if it's negative. For example, joint pain might give them a reason to feel sorry for themselves. So, what satisfaction will the potential customer need to give up in order to solve their problem?

Who they blame:

What external forces does our potential customer blame for their problem? What removes the blame from their shoulders? This could be the government, food corporations, their bosses, their parents, or what gurus have taught them.

## METHODOLOGICAL RECOMMENDATIONS

- Pain points should be general and widely shared within the target audience.
- Desired results should be general and widely shared within the target audience.
- Products they’ve tried in the past should be common and widely known within the target audience.

Now, consolidate all this information into a comprehensive and detailed description of our buyer persona, following the above structure and context.

This summary should include all the deep emotional drivers that inspire people like our potential customer to take action. Include all relevant details and quotes. This will help create effective advertising materials tailored to people through ads, emails, and commercial proposals.

Please use the information below about my market and avatar. You can include demographic and psychographic data, fears, dreams, or any other relevant details. (The more complete, the better).
