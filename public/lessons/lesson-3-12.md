## Facebook Traffic Launch Checklist

This checklist is designed to guide you through the process of launching traffic campaigns on Facebook. 

It covers most of the steps you’ll encounter — from choosing offers to scaling successful campaigns. In traffic arbitrage, there are many different ways to run traffic to offers, so we’ll focus on one method that’s more relevant for the nutra, dating, and crypto verticals, since this approach doesn’t involve using PWA.

Some parts of the information or steps may be outdated as the market is quite dynamic and methods are updated (but there is a lot of useful information here), so if you have any questions, you can contact us.  

## 1. Choosing the Vertical and Offer

1. Select a Vertical: Decide on the niche you want to work in (e.g., gambling, nutra, e-commerce).  
2. Review Affiliate Networks and Offers:

   * Check which offers are available in your chosen vertical.  
   * Contact affiliate managers and ask:  
     * Can this offer be promoted on Facebook?  
     * Is this offer currently being promoted (and by how many affiliates)?  
     * What is the approval rate and conversion rate (per country)?  
     * Is Facebook or Instagram better for this offer?  
     * Are there caps or bumps (increased payouts for exceeding a certain number of leads per day)?

3. Shortlist Offers:  
   * Focus on evergreen offers, seasonal relevance, and broad target audiences.  
   * Use tools like Google Trends, Yandex Wordstat, and Maliru Webmasters to check offer relevance.

4. Compare Offers:  
   * Create a table in Google Docs to list the pros and cons of each offer.
