# Choosing the Right Offer

When you're diving into affiliate marketing, choosing the right offer is absolutely crucial for your success. If you pick the wrong one, you might end up pouring money down the drain, but if you pick the right one, you could be looking at a lucrative opportunity.

So, how do you choose the right offer? There are a few key factors you should consider when picking an offer to run, and I'm going to break them down for you. Trust me, once you get the hang of it, you’ll be able to spot a winner from a mile away.

## 1. Personal Manager’s Advice of Affiliate networks

First and foremost, your personal manager is your best friend. They're the ones with the inside scoop on what offers are performing well. They can give you insights on the latest trends, top offers, and conversion rates. Don’t hesitate to text your manager for advice\! After all, their salary depends on your success. So, if they say a particular offer is hot, you better believe it's worth checking out.


## 2. Statistical Indicators

You may be new to affiliate marketing, but stats are your best friends. Here's a quick breakdown of the key stats you need to know before jumping into any offer:

* Approve Rate: This tells you the percentage of leads that actually convert. If an offer has a 30% approve rate, that means out of 10 leads, only 3 are confirmed. It's simple, but powerful.

* Trash Leads: These are the leads that don’t go anywhere. They may have filled out a form, but when you try to follow up, they either don’t answer or give nonsense responses. Understanding trash leads is important because these don’t count toward your payout.

* Net Approve Rate: This is the real deal. If your manager gives you an estimated approve rate, be sure to subtract 30% for trash leads to get a more accurate picture of your potential payout.

## 3. GEO Features

GEO (geographical location) is another important factor. Not all offers perform equally in every country. Some regions have lower traffic costs but also lower payouts due to lower purchasing power. Here’s a quick rule of thumb:

* Tier 1 countries (like the US, UK, and Canada) generally have higher payouts but come with more competition.

* Tier 2 and Tier 3 countries (Eastern Europe, some parts of Asia) may have cheaper traffic but might require different strategies to make it profitable.

Pro Tip: Test out different countries, especially those with low competition. This will give you an edge and let you scale faster without spending too much.

**Common Mistakes When Choosing Offers**

* Ignoring the offer's traffic rules. For example, using push notifications when they're not allowed could mean you don’t get paid (gambling offers)  
* Choosing offers only by payout. Higher payouts often come with more competition and stricter conversion conditions  
* Working with unknown or poorly rated networks. Some may delay or skip payments, especially for new affiliates  
* Skipping tests. An offer may work well on one platform but fail on another. Always test before scaling
