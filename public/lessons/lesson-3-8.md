# How to Properly Use a Fan Page to Increase Leads

A fan page in the right hands is a powerful tool for attracting clients and boosting lead generation. But just creating a page isn’t enough. To turn it into a real magnet for potential buyers, you need to understand the principles of effective work. Today we’ll talk about why properly setting up your fan page matters and how it can help you further monetize your traffic.

**What is a PZRD Fan Page and why have these pages become a separate product?**

**Short answer:** A PZRD Fan Page is a fan page that was banned but then successfully unblocked through an appeal. Such a page retains its violation history, but Meta’s **Confidence Score** algorithm shifts it into a “conditionally trusted” category, allowing for longer ad delivery.

Until 2021, fan pages were barely regulated, so they were mass-created for each campaign. After the introduction of daily limits on attaching pages and waves of “Off-Platform Misuse” bans, demand shifted towards resources with a confirmed (even negative) history — which led to the rise of a separate market for PZRD FP.

### How does a PZRD FP differ from a regular fresh page?

* **Trust factor**: The algorithm treats a reactivated (unblocked) page as less risky than a fresh one without history.

* **Scalability**: A PZRD FP can be shared across **10–15 accounts** without immediately triggering “Spam Connections.”

* **Lifetime**: Average time before another block is **35–40% longer**, provided you stay within limits.

### What benefits does using a PZRD FP bring in mass ad launches?

**Short answer:** Key benefits are flexible role distribution across accounts, lower risk of instant bans, and cost savings on buying new pages.

#### Economic Model: “1 Page → N Accounts” 

| Parameter | Value | Comment |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Avg. price of PZRD FP | **$90–$130** | Depends on age & audience |
| Max. attachments | **10–15 accounts** | Recommended limit for stability |
| Cost “per account” | **$6–$13** | If you fully use the limit |

### When does a PZRD FP not pay off?

* If the project is **short-term (\<7 days)**

* If you’re running fewer than **5 active accounts** — in that case, it’s cheaper to create and warm up a new page yourself.

###  What limits and “unwritten rules” should you follow for safe use?

**Short answer:**

* No more than **2 campaigns per account**

* No more than **3 Business Managers per profile**

* Don’t exceed **10–15 accounts per one PZRD FP**

### PZRD FP Operator’s Checklist

* Assign one **“anchor” account** as admin — it must stay online 24/7 to quickly republish the page if needed.

* Avoid simultaneous logins from different ASNs; Meta flags sharp network changes as suspicious activity.

* Don’t change the name, description, or avatar more than once every **30 days** — this triggers *Page Quality* resets and wipes trust.

* If the page gets banned, immediately pause campaigns to prevent **Payment Review** on linked accounts.


### Can you build a “bulletproof” setup by pairing an unblocked account with a PZRD FP?

**Short answer:** Lifetime definitely increases, but there’s no such thing as total invulnerability — Meta’s moderation rules on content and behavior still apply.

## Fan Page Setup and Content

* **Name and Logo:** Choose a name that reflects the essence of your offer and is easy to remember. The logo should be eye-catching, memorable, and aligned with your brand style. However, if you plan to post other offers too, don’t use the name of a single offer in your fan page title — instead, choose something more general and health-related.  
* **Design:** Create a unified design style so your fan page looks professional and visually appealing. Use high-quality images, videos, and content that reflect your brand values.  
* **Call-to-Action Buttons:** Add buttons like “Buy,” “Order,” “Learn More” to encourage users to submit a request.  
* **Contacts:** Include your contact information so clients can reach out to you at any time.

To avoid too much theory, here’s how we typically set up a fan page:

First, we choose the offer we’ll run traffic to. In our case, it’s a basic weight loss offer targeting Italy.

Next, we start creating the fan page by coming up with a relevant name and description that reflect what the page is about.

We then add a link to our offer or a landing page with multiple offers, depending on what we have available.

Then we upload a profile picture and a cover photo for the group. These images can usually be found on the offer’s landing page.

In the end, you’ll get something like what you see in the screenshot below. You can take the text for your post straight from the landing page and pair it with a trigger image. Nothing stops you from boosting this post too — gather comments, likes, and shares with just a couple of dollars. Posting new content with different offers once every 2–3 days is enough.

You can also go the other route and create a “personal doctor” persona. Set up landing pages under this persona for different offers, and build the fan page around them. This adds trust. People will think a real doctor is running the page and giving advice on how to cure health problems.

**Common Mistakes When Working with Fan Pages**

**Lack of Content:** Regularly update your fan page with fresh content. Don’t let it go inactive for too long.

**Lack of Engagement:** Respond to user comments. Go into Meta Business Suite, open the Comments section, and hide negative ones.

### Conclusion

If you properly design your fan page and create quality content, you can turn it into an additional source of leads.  
 You don’t necessarily need to create a fan page for a specific offer like “Hypertension Treatment.” Instead, come up with a general name like “Healthy Life” or “Good Health” (you can always ask ChatGPT if creativity isn’t your strong suit).

A general name makes more sense if you plan to post about various offers like weight loss, hypertension, and so on. Most people usually face multiple health issues at once, so there’s a good chance they’ll see an ad in a familiar place, click it, and place an order.

An optimal option would be to buy one aged fan page (PZRD) — with followers or one that was previously used for white-hat offers. Cost is around $10–15 max. Then, share this fan page with the other ad accounts you’ll be using. That way, you have one main fan page for running ads — where users might subscribe, read, and interact.

The important part is to use this one fan page per GEO and per language.  
 Or, by classic playbook, just create your own from scratch, fill it out, and warm it up.

## Fan Page Protection

To protect our ads by up to 90% from being viewed by competitors via spy tools, you can apply certain changes in your Fan Page settings.

You need to switch to the profile of the desired Fan Page \> go to this link: [https://www.facebook.com/settings/?tab=followers\_and\_public\_content](https://www.facebook.com/settings/?tab=followers_and_public_content)  \> Country Restrictions \> enter the country you’re targeting \> check Show only to certain countries \> Save.

We recommend enabling this feature on every Fan Page you work with.

###  Hiding your page from competitor

Continuing the topic of hiding your page from competitors, here’s another trick to hide the macros in your link:

When setting up your ad campaign at the ad level, in the Website URL field, enter the first part of your final link (from your tracker).

Then scroll down, and in the URL parameters field, enter the second part of your link.

This way, when competitors view your ad through a spy tool, they will only see the domain without any extra details.
