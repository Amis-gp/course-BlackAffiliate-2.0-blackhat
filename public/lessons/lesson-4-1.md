# Working with Facebook Campaign Metrics

Launching your Facebook campaign is just the beginning. The real work starts once your ads are live, and from that point on, every decision you make should be based on data. To manage performance effectively, it’s crucial to monitor the key metrics: CTR, CPM, CPL (or CPA), and the number of leads or registrations. These indicators give you insight into how well your funnel is performing and whether you're spending your budget efficiently.  
### How to Access Reports

1. Select the right date range. Make sure you're viewing a period where your ads were actively running.  
2. Go to your Ads Manager table and click on "Customize Columns" in the top-right of the reporting table.

3. Deselect everything so you can start fresh.  
4. Add the metrics that you find relevant. We recommend the following:  
   * Off/On  
   * Ad set  
   * Delivery  
   * Budget  
   * Reach  
   * Impressions  
   * Results  
   * Cost per result  
   * Amount spent  
   * Clicks (all)  
   * CPC (all)  
   * Leads  
   * Cost per lead  
   * Registrations Completed  
   * Cost per registration  
   * CTR (all)  
   * CPM

#### App-Specific Metrics for Gambling

* App Installs → The number of people who installed your app.  
* Mobile App Installs → Similar to "App Installs" but focuses only on mobile.  
* Events → Actions inside the app (like purchases or registrations).  
* Save your layout

Now you'll have a clear, detailed view of what's really performing in your account.

## Scaling: When and How

Scaling too early can hurt your campaigns more than help. But if you're consistently seeing ROI above 30%, and the offer is delivering stable results (confirmed deposits, steady lead flow, no sudden bans), you can begin scaling.

The most common approach is incremental budget increases. Raising your daily budget by 20–30% allows the algorithm to adjust gradually without disrupting performance. Another proven strategy is duplicating the campaign and running it in new GEOs or with fresh creatives.

At the same time, optimization should remain part of your daily process. Start trimming out underperforming ad sets, placements, and segments. Keep the most efficient parts of the campaign and reinvest your budget there.  
tip

If your Cost per Install (CPI) is too high, you may need to optimize your ad creatives, audience targeting, or bidding strategy. If your Click-Through Rate (CTR) is low, your ads might not be engaging enough.

## What to Do After You Find a Winning Combination

If you've found a campaign setup that generates positive ROI and stable results, you’ve entered the next phase: optimization and scaling.  
Focus next on:

* Turning off poor-performing ad sets or creatives  
* Increasing budget only on top performers  
* Testing and rotating new creatives regularly  
* Reviewing GEO/device breakdowns for weak points  
* Watching for night-time performance drops (optional pause)

example  
You are running ads in Brazil for a deposit offer. Your data:

* Cost per Install → $12  
* CPM → $15  
* CTR (Click-Through Rate) → 1%  
* Total Spend → $360  
* Installs → 30  
* Registrations → 10  
* Deposits → 2

What does this mean?

Your ROI (Return on Investment) is very low and there’s room for optimization. You need to:

* Lower the cost per install → Test different creatives (ad images & videos).  
* Improve CTR → Make the ad more engaging to attract more clicks.

## When to Optimize, When to Scale

Avoid scaling in these situations:

* ROI is below 30 percent and inconsistent  
* No stable FTDs for at least 3 to 5 days  
* Traffic source or infrastructure is unstable  
* Frequent bans or rejections on creatives or apps  
* Unpredictable CPMs or policy issues

On the other hand, you should scale when:

* ROI is above 30 to 70 percent  
* FTDs are stable over several days  
* Funnel and app performance are consistent  
* Campaigns are running without bans or disruptions

## Scaling Strategies

There are three main methods for scaling campaigns:

### Horizontal scaling

* Duplicate your winning combination across other accounts, apps, or BM setups.  
* Use different domains and landing paths to prevent oversaturation.  
* Clone landing pages and structure in your tracker.

### Vertical scaling

* Gradually increase the daily budget by 10 to 30 percent per day.  
* Consider setting automation rules (e.g., add $15 every hour via Dolphin or another tool).

### Parallel scaling

* Add more offers for the same audience (different casinos or clone-offers).  
* Route traffic to multiple destinations using tracker split-tests.  
* Run A/B tests for different offers with auto-rotation enabled.

## App Infrastructure Considerations

If you’re using apps, take the following into account:

* WebView apps are harder to scale due to stricter moderation.  
* Change package name, app icon, title, and signature (keystore) when cloning.  
* PWA setups are the easiest to clone, just duplicate the landing page and domain.

## Why Testing Is Always Important

No campaign delivers perfect results forever. Audiences change, competition shifts, and platform algorithms evolve. Even if an ad performs well today, it may stop converting tomorrow. That’s why continuous testing is essential. By regularly experimenting with new creatives, refining targeting, and analyzing performance data, you can adapt to changes and keep your campaigns profitable.
