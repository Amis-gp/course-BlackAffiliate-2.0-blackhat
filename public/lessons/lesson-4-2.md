# What Budget to Use for Launching Ad Campaigns and How to Properly Test Bundles?

Many people get confused: some launch with the minimum, others go in with big budgets right away. So where’s the truth, and how should you act to avoid wasting money?

🍷 **Here’s what you need to keep in mind**

### 1. The Vertical – the foundation of your strategy

Different verticals deliver different volumes of daily events. For example, if you're working with an offer that typically brings only 1–2 leads per day, a small budget simply won’t generate enough data.

In such cases, Facebook often pauses the learning phase with the message *“not enough results”*, and your test never fully opens up. That’s why you need to **evaluate in advance how many actions you can realistically get per day**, and set your initial budget accordingly.

### 2. The GEO – not just about cost, but also reach

If you’re targeting expensive GEOs like the **USA, Canada, or Germany**, running a test with a daily budget of $20–25 will likely be too slow.

Such countries require **at least $60–70 per day (per ad set)** for your ad to start collecting meaningful data. The higher the **CPM** in a region, the more budget you’ll need to set in order to get any statistically significant numbers — and to quickly understand whether your bundle is working or not.

### 3. Launch format: campaign or ad sets?

If you're using a **campaign-level budget** (CAA or Advantage+), it makes sense to allocate, say, **$120 per day** and split it between a few ad set duplicates — for example, 3–4. That’s more than enough for initial analysis.

If you're setting the **budget at the ad set level**, then just divide the amount. For instance, **$90 per day** would mean **$30 for each of the three ad sets**.

## What is CBO?

That’s the **old but still effective model** where the **budget is set at the campaign level**, not per ad set.

✅ **How it works:**

You assign, say, **$100 to a campaign** with **3 ad sets**, and **Facebook automatically decides how much to spend on each one**: maybe 70% to the first, 20% to the second, and 10% to the third — depending on performance.

📌 **Works well when:**

* You want **automatic budget redistribution** between ad sets  
* You’ve already done basic tests and want to **scale**  
  You **don’t want to manually manage** everything

There have been cases where a campaign with a minimal budget showed **zero leads on Day 1**, but the very next day it turned profitable.

 If the budget had been higher, you might’ve shut it off too early — thinking the bundle was unprofitable. But over a longer run, it actually performed great.

That’s why it’s not only about **how much** you spend — but also **how long** you let a campaign “breathe.” **Facebook doesn’t care about your numbers — it works off patterns.** The longer the ad runs, the more chances the algorithm has to find your audience.

⛔️ **About patterns — those with experience and a trained eye know exactly what this means.**  
 Results can vary wildly, even when you re-run a campaign with the exact same settings and creatives — and sometimes the new run performs **worse** than the original.

**It happens\!**
