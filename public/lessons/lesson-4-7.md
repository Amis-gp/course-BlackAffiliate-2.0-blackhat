**For example, Gambling niche**

1. **Test Different Audiences and Placements**  
    To find consistently performing ad sets, you need more experiments with targeting and placements. Here’s what you can try:

* By default, Facebook sets the Advantage+ audience, which sometimes works great, but sometimes standard settings perform better—everything needs testing.

* **Advantage+ vs Manual Placements**: Your strategy with Advantage+ placements is working, but test manual placements (e.g., only Feed, Stories, and Reels)—sometimes this gives a better CTR.  
* **Exclude PCs from targeting**: Try removing desktop devices from your targeting.  
* **Test iOS and Android separately**: Run ad sets for iOS only or Android only. Also, exclude older versions (e.g., iOS \< 14, Android \< 10)—older devices may convert poorly.  
* **Test Incremental Attribution**: Try using incremental attribution in some ad sets.  
* **Refine age targeting**: Your current range (23-54, all genders) is one audience segment, but you need to hook different segments:  
  * Men: 23-40, 30-50, 35-55, 25-55  
  * Women: 23-40, 30-50, 35-55, 25-55  
  * Men \+ Women: 23-40, 30-50, 35-55, 25-55

2. **Experiment with Budgets**  
    Your $7.99 budget per ad set is a good start, but scaling requires testing:  
* **Test different budgets**: Launch ad sets with small ($2-6), medium ($15-25), and larger ($30-50) budgets to find the optimal range.  
* **Increase budgets carefully**: If an ad set is performing well, raise the budget by no more than 10-15% every 2 days. Increasing too quickly can disrupt the algorithm and cause you to lose the “spark” (when the audience is perfectly matched).

3. **Create More Ad Creatives**  
    Set up a mini-pipeline that generates a certain number of creatives for testing. Uniqueize some of them based on successful variants and create others using references.

You’ve already tried duplicating ad sets and campaigns, and it sometimes works—keep going\! In Facebook advertising, everything hinges on catching the audience’s attention with ad sets, so you need to launch lots of ad sets to find the “spark.” I know it can be tough, but that’s how everyone does it. The core principle of scaling lies in having a large number of ad sets, but this requires a corresponding number of creatives. Ideally, launch tests with 10 static creatives at once.

Set up automated rules in Ads Manager to automatically pause ad sets with poor performance—this will help a bit.

4. **Diversify GEOs and Offers**  
    Scaling only in Turkey is tough—the market is oversaturated since many media buyers are pouring big budgets there. Try:  
* **Add new GEOs**: Pick 2-3 additional Tier-2/3 countries (e.g., Mexico, India, Brazil, or something else).  
* **Test multiple offers**: Your issue with instability and scaling difficulties is normal for the gambling vertical, especially when focusing on a single GEO.

### A principle that works across all verticals

1. As soon as the creative catches on and starts delivering results, increase the budget by 2–5x the original amount, then return it back at the end of the day.

For example: you were running on **$50 daily**, and you see **2–3 conversions** — increase the budget by **2–5x** (up to you). At the **end of the day** (right before the new auction cycle), set it back to **$50**.

2. Duplicating ad sets
