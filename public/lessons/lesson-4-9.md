## Step 4: Configure Language Strategy

**Primary Language:**  
Choose a non-target language (e.g., African, Arabic, etc.)

**Additional Language:**  
Add German (or your target language) where you place your **"black creative"**

**All Other Languages:**  
Upload your **"white creative"** (safe, non-triggering content)

## How It Works

The moderation system sees multiple "white creatives" across different languages, while your "black creative" is hidden among them. This disperses the moderation focus and increases approval chances.
