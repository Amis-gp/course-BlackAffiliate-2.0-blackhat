# New method

## New method for bypassing creative moderation

In targeting settings, select the desired GEO.

Go to ad editing.

Scroll down to the "languages" section and enable it.

![Languages Section](/img/4.9/image3.webp)

Choose a primary language that is not the target (for example, African, Arabic, etc.).

Add German as an additional language, where you'll place your "black creative."

For all other languages, upload your "white creative," which doesn't trigger the moderation system.

This way, the ad will actually be shown in the required language, increasing your chances of passing moderation.

This method disperses the moderation system by publishing many "white creatives," among which there is one "black creative."
