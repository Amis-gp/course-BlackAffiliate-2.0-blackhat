Running Gambling Traffic on FB\*: What Has Changed Recently

Facebook\* has always been a challenging traffic source for beginners, but lately, it has become increasingly difficult even for experienced webmasters. This is due to constant changes in the platform’s algorithms and anti-fraud systems. The rules have tightened to the point where FB\* blocks even innocent accounts of regular users, let alone those running ads. 

To avoid bans, you need to constantly study FB’s rules and monitor your setup for compliance or violations.

Advertising casinos on Facebook\* is prohibited. If a casino has a license, it may be possible to run ads, but only in compliance with the GEO’s legislation, strict platform rules, negotiations with the administration, and by providing all necessary documentation. Not every beginner in affiliate marketing, looking to run gambling traffic, is able to obtain such a license and present it to FB\*.

Running Gambling Traffic on FB\*: Challenges and Opportunities

Even when working with white-hat offers on FB\*, you may encounter: 

* Bans of well-prepared Fan Pages and ad accounts.  
* Requirements to verify payment methods.  
* Numerous restrictions on advertising activities.  
* Micro-spending issues, where ad spend limits are reduced.

On the positive side, recent developments include the emergence of new GEOs. Many countries have legalized online casinos, leading to an increase in the number of offers and advertisers.

## How to Choose a GEO for Running Gambling Offers on Facebook

Choosing the right GEO depends on several factors:

1. Personal Experience and Knowledge  
   For example, if an affiliate marketer has already worked with a specific GEO, running traffic for another vertical or testing a different source, it makes sense to continue focusing on that country. Existing knowledge and insights can help quickly navigate campaign launches and select relevant creatives.  
2. Budget  
   Tier-3 GEOs require a smaller budget compared to Tier-1. Beginners or solo affiliate marketers are better off starting with Tier-3 and choosing GEOs with minimal competition. For instance, there are countries many affiliates aren’t even aware of, yet their audiences actively engage with casinos.  
3. Offer  
   It’s crucial that the offer isn’t oversaturated in the chosen GEO. Otherwise, the campaign could result in losses. The same applies to creatives—always use an approach that competitors haven’t tried.

Earnings largely depend not just on the GEO, but on volume and ROI. Experienced affiliates recommend targeting Eastern Europe and CIS countries due to lower competition and cheaper traffic.

### Analyzing GEOs Using Spy Services

It’s important to analyze GEOs using spy tools. Pay attention to:

* The number of ads run per month and per week.  
* Which offers are being advertised.  
* How long ads stayed in the auction.

Based on the collected data, draw conclusions about the level of competition.
