# FB King Account Setup

## 1\. Choosing an offer*

* We analyze competitors, analyze existing offers, conditions, payments, geo

* Choose an offer for PWA 

## 2\. Account Preparation:

* Purchase an Agency account for work

* Set up your Fan Page to match the design of your PWA. Add a few posts related to your niche so that if a user clicks on the Fan Page, they don’t lose trust and continue down the funnel via the Fan Page link.

* Use one Fan Page for 2-3 ad accounts and for one offer.

## 3\. Business Manager Setup(If you work on your own BM):
Contact your agency account provider, ask for a pixel, you can create it on your King account and then transfer it to the agency

* [Facebook Business Settings](https://business.facebook.com/latest/settings) 

* Log into the King’s Business Manager (BM).

* Link it to an existing BM and add 3-4 ad accounts.

## 4\. Pixel API Setup:

* Create a Pixel API conversion and name it based on your domain \+ GEO for convenience.

## 6\. Sharing Pixel Access:

* Share pixel access with all active ad accounts.

* Add user access for a pixel

## ZM Apps \- PWA 
Go to https://zm.app/, create a PWA design, and customize it.

## Launching an advertising account

1. Campaign Launch Strategy (1:3:1):  
   * For fresh accounts, use the 1:3:1 system:  
     * 1 Campaign  
     * 3 Ad Sets  
     * 1 Ad  
   * After reaching a certain spend threshold, you can launch new campaigns.

2. Campaign Scheduling:  
   * Set the campaign launch time to 00:00 based on the account’s time zone. This is mandatory as it helps improve ad delivery.

## Recommendations 

When setting up an ad on FB, select the “play” button

In the “link to show” field, paste the link to Google Play there

We launch traffic only on mobile devices (depending on the Android/iOS offer)

We use UTM tags for our link to the offer, write values for different Sub

You need to post at least 5 comments on our PWA

   
**Rules for passing moderation:**

- Be sure to set the scheduled launch for 00:00 the next day, according to the time zone of your account  
    
- Video creative should last more than 3 minutes (our content is about 30-40 seconds, then we give white content)

- You need to remove metadata before uploading to Ads manager [https://online-metadata.com/en](https://online-metadata.com/en) 


- Video should be compressed to 20mb [https://www.video2edit.com/](https://www.video2edit.com/) 

- Create or generate a unique cover for the video, add the cover in the ad settings

<img src="/img/5.10/image3.webp" alt="image" width="50%">

Example

- Uniqueize texts through various services [https://fsymbols.com/generators/](https://fsymbols.com/generators/) 

- Fill in as many ad fields as possible (title, description, body text) to reduce the risk of being banned. We can test the text or emoji with a country flag or something else. In the title, we can try to give the emoji a star, sometimes it works well

- In the targeting settings, we add Antarctica to the geo we have chosen, there will be no impressions there, but it will help to confuse the FB moderation

## Our Global Goal: 

1. Drive Traffic from Multiple Accounts Linked to Our Pixel:  
   * Use several accounts connected to our pixel to maximize data collection.

2. Gather as Much Data as Possible:  
   * Allow the pixel to learn and understand which audience to target.

3. Pixel Training for Specific GEO and Audience:  
   * The pixel learns based on the specific GEO and audience, enabling it to be linked to other Business Managers and accounts in the future.

4. Launch Traffic, Pass Moderation, and Start Showing Ads:  
   * Begin traffic campaigns, ensure ads pass moderation, and start displaying them.

5. Monitor Metrics and Optimize:
