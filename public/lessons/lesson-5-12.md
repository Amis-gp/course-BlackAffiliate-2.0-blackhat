# Game plan:

## Step 1: Link Accounts to Business Manager

* Depending on the type of accounts you're using, we recommend working with **agency ad accounts** for running traffic. Get in touch with the seller and clarify the details regarding how the ad account will be handed over — the process can vary slightly from one seller to another.  
* Read more about account mechanics and Business Manager here:

   [Setup Instructions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UrKcP95qasXqDNei6KrTUgotdXWt60YiGuMySd1EHE0/edit?usp=sharing)

  **Accounts**: Trusted Facebook accounts from Fan Agency \- TG @funagency (no farming). In case of account problems or bans, the agency issues a new account.

## Step 2: Set Up Fan Pages

* Log into each account and check for an existing Fan Page.  
* Once you’ve chosen your offers, rename the Fan Pages to match the offer’s vibe (something close to the offer’s name).  
* Add an avatar, photo Profile header, page description, you need to specify the geo of your offer, and 1-3 post with text and a link to your offer.  
   *Why?* Ads run through the Fan Page, so it needs to look legit. If a user clicks from the ad to the page instead of the offer, they shouldn’t lose trust in you. In auctions, the fan page participates first, and only then the ad itself. That's why profile completeness and trust level matter.

  \- Run post boosts on the page  
  \- Send traffic to warm it

## Step 3: Create and Share a Pixel

* Create a pixel through your Business Manager and share access with the necessary accounts.  
* We typically use one pixel \= 1 geo \= 1–3 offers.  
* This step is covered in the instructions linked in Step 2\.

## Step 4: Spy on Competitor Creatives

* Use the SPY service to check out competitor creatives for your target geos.  
* If you find good ones, either download and uniquify them or take the concept and create something new.

## Step 5: Link Payment Cards to Ad Accounts

* Add payment cards to your ad accounts.  
* Heads-up: This can get tricky if the card BINs are low-quality or if other Media Buyers using those cards didn’t pay their bills—FB might flag them. It’s normal; just test a few different cards.

  *This is only relevant if you do not work on agency accounts*

* Tip: Choose countries without VAT to avoid extra ad taxes.

## Step 6: Set Up the PWA

* Set up a PWA and grab the final link to use in your ads.  
* Quick question: Are you familiar with PWA? It’s the go-to method for running traffic on gambling offers right now.

* For PWA, use services like [PWA GROUP](https://pwa.group/) to set up app design and cloaking. We’ll use Keitaro as a tracker in this setup.  
* Why PWA? It’s a site that mimics the Play Market or App Store. You can customize designs, reviews, and visuals for your “app.” Users click from the ad to the site, download the app, and the offer opens in a webview. You can also set up push notifications to remind users about the offer and deposits.
