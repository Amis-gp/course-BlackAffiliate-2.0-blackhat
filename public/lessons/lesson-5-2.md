# Main Types of Casino Games

### Crash/Instant Win (Chicken Road, Crash, Aviator, Balloon)

These games have simple gameplay: place a bet, watch the multiplier grow, and “cash out” at the right moment — the player decides when to exit and take the winnings. A key feature is high volatility, fast dynamics, and the risk of losing almost instantly, which in practice attracts younger users from the crypto and TikTok audiences. Players often don’t stick around long, so traffic quality may be lower.

**Chicken Road** — a variation of a crash game. The player chooses difficulty, watches the chicken go through the level, and cashes out before it “burns.”

**Aviator/Balloon** — analogues with the same mechanics: the excitement is built on the fear of holding longer to win bigger.

**Crash (Spribe, Turbo, others)** — the classic multiplier game where the key point is to “catch the cashout.”

Such games usually perform well in specific GEOs (e.g., LATAM/CIS); players love the fast process, but LTV is low.


### Plinko

**Plinko** is a game where a ball or chip drops through a field of obstacles and lands in a slot that determines the payout. It’s an **arcade casino game** that works well for short sessions and instant-win mechanics.

The risk: players switch quickly, and the market is saturated with Plinko variations, so conversion depends heavily on design, RTP, extra features, and target GEO.

### Slots (Slot Games, Joker, HellHot, SunEgypt, Zeus Olimp)

**Slots** are the most stable casino game type with the best player retention. Games differ by themes, number of reels, bonuses, graphics, and volatility.

**Joker, HellHot, SunEgypt, Zeus Olimp** — classic video slots with various themes (Egypt, myths, fruits, etc.).

Differences between versions (e.g., multiple Zeus Olimp) are separate instances of the same offer — they may have different RTPs, designs, bonuses, or be optimized for different GEOs or operators. The reason is marketing testing for specific markets, providers, or language versions.


### Other Relevant Formats

* **Mines, Dice, Wheel of Fortune** — simple instant-win games, popular in crypto casinos.

* **Live Casino (Roulette, Blackjack)** — provide higher lifetime value but are harder to convert.

* **Keno, Lotteries** — perform best in GEOs like CIS and LATAM.

### GEO Trends in 2025

* **Tier 1 (Canada, Germany, Sweden, UK):** Live casino, AR/VR slots, classic slots, VIP offers; high LTV, minimal churn.

* **Tier 2 (Brazil, India, Turkey):** Crash games (Aviator, Crash), mini-games, mobile-first offers, localized slots; mobile growth. (Gates of Olympus at the top)

* **Tier 3 (Nigeria, Philippines, Africa, LATAM):** Balloon, Chicken Road, Plinko, crash and fast-win games; simple UX, low check size, high churn, low LTV; demand for local payment methods.


### Why Are There Multiple Versions of the Same Game?

Different versions (e.g., Plinko or Zeus Olimp) are products from different providers. Each tweaks RTP, visuals, or bonus mechanics.

For a media buyer this means:

* Different player retention levels

* Different CTR/conversion rates for various audiences

* Ability to test multiple offers under the same game name → more options for A/B testing

Some versions burn out quickly due to low RTP or basic gameplay, while others maintain a “long wave” of retention.
