# Main Types of Casino Games

### Crash/Instant Win (Chicken Road, Crash, Aviator, Balloon)

These games have simple gameplay: place a bet, watch the multiplier grow, and “cash out” at the right moment — the player decides when to exit and take the winnings. A key feature is high volatility, fast dynamics, and the risk of losing almost instantly, which in practice attracts younger users from the crypto and TikTok audiences. Players often don’t stick around long, so traffic quality may be lower.

**Chicken Road** — a variation of a crash game. The player chooses difficulty, watches the chicken go through the level, and cashes out before it “burns.”

**Aviator/Balloon** — analogues with the same mechanics: the excitement is built on the fear of holding longer to win bigger.

**Crash (Spribe, Turbo, others)** — the classic multiplier game where the key point is to “catch the cashout.”

Such games usually perform well in specific GEOs (e.g., LATAM/CIS); players love the fast process, but LTV is low.


### Plinko

**Plinko** is a game where a ball or chip drops through a field of obstacles and lands in a slot that determines the payout. It’s an **arcade casino game** that works well for short sessions and instant-win mechanics.

The risk: players switch quickly, and the market is saturated with Plinko variations, so conversion depends heavily on design, RTP, extra features, and target GEO.

### Slots (Slot Games, Joker, HellHot, SunEgypt, Zeus Olimp)

**Slots** are the most stable casino game type with the best player retention. Games differ by themes, number of reels, bonuses, graphics, and volatility.

**Joker, HellHot, SunEgypt, Zeus Olimp** — classic video slots with various themes (Egypt, myths, fruits, etc.).

Differences between versions (e.g., multiple Zeus Olimp) are separate instances of the same offer — they may have different RTPs, designs, bonuses, or be optimized for different GEOs or operators. The reason is marketing testing for specific markets, providers, or language versions.


### Other Relevant Formats

* **Mines, Dice, Wheel of Fortune** — simple instant-win games, popular in crypto casinos.

* **Live Casino (Roulette, Blackjack)** — provide higher lifetime value but are harder to convert.

* **Keno, Lotteries** — perform best in GEOs like CIS and LATAM.

### Social Casino

Social casino is a free-to-play game format that doesn't involve betting real money. Players use coins or credits, which they buy or get as bonuses, and play slots, wheel games, poker, or bingo. All winnings are only in in-game currency, with no real monetization, though some social casinos offer prizes, trips, or bonuses to partner casinos.

The most popular games: Buffalo, Classic Fruits/777, Zeus (similar to Gate of Olympus), Vegas Nights, Wheel of Fortune, Gold Fish, Dragon & Panda Slots.

Top platforms/products: Slotomania, House of Fun, Huuuge Casino, DoubleDown, myVegas, Caesars Casino.

Regions: USA, Canada, UK, Australia, Asia.

Typical RTP: 94–96%, design is bright and cartoonish.

Social casino is often used in a mix to drive traffic to real casino offers, since the traffic is cheaper, easier to moderate, and aimed at casual audiences. You can also use creatives featuring demo mode from popular slots to guide users toward original games or partner promotions.

For affiliate teams, this is a separate type of creative that lets you test new audiences, use entertainment value, and funnel a wider user base. Later on, you can retarget them to real casinos or special social casino bonus deals.

### Why Are There Multiple Versions of the Same Game?

Different versions (e.g., Plinko or Zeus Olimp) are products from different providers. Each tweaks RTP, visuals, or bonus mechanics.

For a media buyer this means:

* Different player retention levels

* Different CTR/conversion rates for various audiences

* Ability to test multiple offers under the same game name → more options for A/B testing

Some versions burn out quickly due to low RTP or basic gameplay, while others maintain a “long wave” of retention.
