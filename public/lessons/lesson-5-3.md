# Link VS Apps

When running gambling traffic, one of the most critical decisions is choosing between web links (traditional landing pages) and mobile apps (PWA, Store apps, or WebView). Each approach has distinct advantages and trade-offs that directly impact your conversion rates, approve rates, and overall ROI.

Understanding these differences will help you optimize your campaigns and choose the right funnel structure for each GEO and offer.

## Comparison Table

| Dimension | Web (link) | Mobile App (PWA / Store / WebView) | Why it matters |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|----------------|
| **Presence on device** | ❌ none | ✅ icon on home screen | Persistent "owned" channel raises return rates and deposit frequency. |
| **Push & re-engagement** | Limited (web push blocked by many, iOS needs A2HS) | ✅ rich push + segmentation | Pushes convert dormant trials into FTDs; segmentation = smarter promos. |
| **Gamification & UX** | Limited by browser; heavy JS = slow | ✅ native-like speed, mini-games, spin wheels, streaks | Better micro-conversions → higher CR2 and ARPU. |
| **Conversion rate (CR1→reg, reg→FTD)** | Lower; drop on slow loads/domain distrust | Higher; "app context" + faster flows | Expect uplift on approve rate and fewer bounced regs. |
| **Approve rate (KYC/anti-fraud)** | Lower trust; more bot/noise | Higher; device signals better, behavior telemetry richer | Less junk → higher ROI with the same spend. |
| **Spy invisibility** | ❌ pages/clickpaths are scrappable | ✅ much harder to index | Protects approaches, slows down copycats. |
| **Rotations/splits** | URL-level only; resets learning | In-app routers, per-cohort | Keep ad IDs stable while swapping brands/offers under the hood. |
| **"Auto-replace" when blocked** | Domains burn, need new links | ✅ hot-swap apps/flows | Saves live spend; fewer learning resets on Meta/TikTok. |
| **Full funnel view** | Fragmented (LP → reg → dep across tools) | ✅ install→events→FTD in one container | Cleaner cohort math; easier to find the money leaks. |
| **Analytics depth** | Cookies degrade; ATT kills cross-app | ✅ device-level, in-app events | Better value rules and optimizer signals. |
| **In-app ad traffic** | Not applicable | ✅ unlocks in-app placements & app-focused buys | More inventory beyond classic feeds. |
| **Built-in cloaking/compliance** | TDS on domains (fragile) | ✅ app-level policies, store/PWA tricks | Fewer instant bans; longer campaigns. |
| **Attribution** | Heavily cookie/server-side | ✅ install referrer / in-app SDK events | Smoother value-optimization in ad platforms. |
| **Tracker optimization** | URL params only | ✅ deep event & cohort optimization | Lets you optimize on behaviors, not just clicks. |
| **Trust/brand perception** | "Another landing page" | "Installed app" halo (esp. with ratings) | Lifts intent and lowers fear around deposits. |
| **Speed of iteration** | ✅ instant | Slower (build/review) — PWA is fast | For rapid A/B of creatives/offers web is king. |
| **Friction to enter** | ✅ 1 click | Extra step (install/add to home) | Web wins at CR0 (click→view); app wins downstream. |
| **Store risks** | None | Review/bans/dev accounts | Must be managed (farm, ratings, updates). |
| **GEO/regulatory sensitivity** | Easier to stay gray | Stricter in some GEOs | In hard-reg GEOs, lean PWA + web. |
| **Desktop traffic** | ✅ yes | Limited | Keep web for desktop + search. |
| **Ops overhead** | Low (domains/TDS) | Higher (builds, updates, accounts, push ops) | Plan resources and SLAs. |
| **Cost structure** | Domains/proxies/antibot | Dev accounts, builds, ratings + sub fee | Apps cost more upfront; pay back in LTV. |

## Key Takeaways

**When to Use Web Links:**

- Quick testing and iteration of new creatives or offers
- Desktop traffic campaigns
- Markets with strict regulatory requirements
- Lower operational overhead and simpler infrastructure
- Immediate deployment without review processes

**When to Use Mobile Apps (PWA/Store/WebView):**

- Long-term campaigns focused on retention and LTV
- Push notification re-engagement strategies
- Higher conversion rates and approve rates needed
- Spy protection and competitive advantage
- Better analytics and attribution tracking
- Unlocking in-app ad inventory
