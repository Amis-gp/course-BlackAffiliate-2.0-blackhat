# PWA Builder

## Introduction

PWA Builder is a tool for creating Progressive Web Applications (PWAs). Before you start building a new PWA, note some important features.

### What you need to know before you begin:

**AI Generation** – A feature that automatically creates text or avatars. Fields with this feature have a button to activate it.

**Auto-translation** – A feature that automatically translates the app text to the browser language. All fields that support auto-translation are marked with a special icon and a note under the field.

Auto-translation works only if the field is left empty. To disable this feature, toggle the Auto-translate switch.
