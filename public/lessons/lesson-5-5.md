# App Banned: What to Do If You Only Know How to Run Traffic on Apps, and They Keep Getting Banned?

Many verticals, especially gambling, heavily rely on apps—primarily for Android. As a result, an affiliate marketer’s setup becomes dependent not only on the whims of Facebook but also on the policies of the Google Play Store.

### What Happens When the Store Goes into an Aggressive Phase?

* A wave of app bans follows.  
* Sellers run out of available apps and rent out the last remaining ones, which are also likely to get banned soon.  
* Affiliate marketers face the frustration of paused ad campaigns, banned ad accounts, and wasted budgets on dead apps.

### How to Adapt?

Many teams are now directing most of their traffic to PWA (Progressive Web Apps). Others are gradually learning to work with PWAs, as app bans are only going to increase. If you’re not prepared for this shift, your team could face financial ruin.

At the very least, most teams will struggle until they master running traffic on PWAs—at least reaching the same skill level they had with native apps.  

### Why PWA?

1. Permanence:  
   * The app is not removed from traffic sources (unlike Google Play, where blocks are possible).

2. Flexibility:  
   * You can create any type of landing page (even aggressive or non-standard ones, which are prohibited in official app stores).  
   * Example: A landing page styled to look like Google Play for a casino.

3. Push Notifications:  
   * Ability to send notifications to users (just like in regular apps).

4. Traffic Sources:  
   * You can use any traffic sources (Facebook, manual ad purchases from bloggers, Telegram, etc.).  
   * No additional costs for "padding" (if the advertiser accepts traffic without moderation).

3\. Disadvantages of PWA:

1. Cost:  
   * Free PWA builders are rare. Usually, you need to pay for access to platforms or bots.

2. Promotion Complexity:  
   * Traffic is often "lost" due to Facebook/Google filters.  
   * No optimization for deposits (only for installs), which reduces conversion rates.

3. Lack of Trust:  
   * Users notice that the app is not from Google Play, which can raise suspicions.

4. Limited Effectiveness:  
   * Based on feedback, PWAs often show lower performance compared to official apps.

4\. How to Run Ads for PWA (Using Facebook as an Example):

1. Campaign Setup:  
   * Objective: "Leads."  
   * Placements: Mobile devices only (Android 9.0+).  
   * Targeting: Age/gender audience, geolocation (based on offer requirements).

2. Pixel Creation:  
   * Add a Facebook pixel to track conversions.  
   * In the "Site URL" field, insert the link to the PWA.

3. Ad Creation:  
   * Use aggressive headlines and images (e.g., "Money, slots, cards\!").  
   * Add the fb\_eq=Pixel\_ID parameter to the URL for tracking.

4. Publishing:  
   * Launch the campaign and monitor statistics.
