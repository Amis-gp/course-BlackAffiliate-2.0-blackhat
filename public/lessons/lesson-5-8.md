# Test PWA Installation

It's important to test how your **PWA app** works before starting the traffic. This helps to make sure everything looks correct and the installation works without errors. The test only takes a few minutes.

> **Important**  
> During the whole installation process:
> 
> - Do not change your IP address or VPN.
> - Do not switch between mobile data and Wi-Fi.
> - If the network changes, the installation tracking will break.

## Step 1: Copy the link to your flow
