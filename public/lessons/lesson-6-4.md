# Reasons for Low Conversion in Gambling and Betting

We’ve compiled a list of the top reasons that affect conversion rates in gambling and betting. Sometimes the issue isn’t with your creatives or traffic sources, but with the product itself.

We’ll break down the most critical problems so you can understand when to reach out to your affiliate manager or account manager, and when it’s better to avoid the offer altogether.

### When the Project Was Launched

On one hand, new casinos often have higher conversion rates. The product isn’t oversaturated, and players haven’t registered there yet. However, if the project is brand new and hasn’t worked on its social proof, the conversion rate might be very low at the start.

On the other hand, it can be problematic if the project is very old. Yes, it may have a reputation in the market, but the number of players who might be interested decreases over time.

### Does the Project Have a License, and Is It Valid?

Some advertisers don’t pay enough attention to licensing. They might have a license but don’t mention it, or they might not have one at all. The reality is that reviewers have conditioned players to think: no license means the casino is bad.

### Lack of Product Localization

Some advertisers believe that they can launch a casino in English and target all GEOs. However, in many countries, people don’t know English, and even in places where they do, they might not register if the platform isn’t localized to their language.

How Support Works  
Ideally, support should respond not only in English but also in the language of the region where the product is being promoted. As we’ve already mentioned, not everyone knows English, and having support in the local language builds trust.

Additionally, support should operate 24/7 and respond promptly. The contact form should be simple and convenient to use, whether on a phone or a computer.  
 

### Complexity of Registration

The fewer fields during registration, the higher the conversion rate. The ideal setup: only an email or phone number is required, and a password is sent to it. You can also use registration through social networks, via phone number \+ password, or email \+ password.

However, you should avoid registration forms that require users to fill in their first name, last name, email, phone number, password, date of birth, city, etc.

Deposit and Withdrawal Methods  
It’s crucial for a casino or betting platform to offer local payment methods. You need to consider what’s popular in each specific GEO. For example, in Tier 1 countries, cryptocurrency is often preferred as a payment method. In Brazil, however, local payment systems are widely used by residents. 

### What Data is Collected About the Player

A casino without verification is unrealistic. But verification can vary. It’s one thing when you’re asked for a photo of your passport and card. However, sometimes affiliates require 10 documents for verification, such as proof of residence, utility bills, bank statements, etc.

When players see such a list of required documents, they often leave for other platforms.

### Which Providers Are Available on the Site

Slots from well-known providers tend to have higher conversion rates compared to slots from no-name developers. Additionally, popular slots inspire more trust, as players know that others have won on them before.  
It’s also important to adapt the “Top Slots” section to different GEOs, as the top slots vary by country.

### Landing Pages and Pre-Landing Pages in the GEO’s Language

Advertisers should have high-quality landing pages and pre-landing pages that are tailored to the GEO and help warm up the traffic. For example, a landing page with bonuses, a registration page highlighting the casino’s advantages, or a page with a Fortune Wheel. 

### Welcome Bonuses

Welcome bonuses significantly impact conversion rates, as do the wagering requirements. Many users won’t make a deposit if they see that the casino or betting platform has overly strict requirements for using the bonus. Percentage bonuses on deposits, free spins, and free bets tend to convert well. 

### Does the Advertiser Retain Players?

Retention and LTV (Lifetime Value) are also influenced by the advertiser’s efforts. If you’re working on a RevShare model, make sure that players receive bonus push notifications, newsletters about new promotions, and reminders to complete their registration.

However, it’s important not to overdo it. If the casino sends emails every day, there’s a chance the player will unsubscribe altogether.

### Are There Fraud Complaints, and How Are They Handled?

Advertisers should actively manage reviews, especially those accusing their product of fraud. They should address negative feedback and try to resolve issues. When a player searches for information about the product, they shouldn’t immediately encounter negative experiences from other users.

## Conclusion  

When searching for a gambling or betting offer and trying to understand what negatively impacts conversion, go through the user experience from start to finish. This way, you’ll identify at which stage players start having doubts, understand what might eliminate those doubts, and be able to suggest improvements to the advertiser.
