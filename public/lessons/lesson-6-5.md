### Case Study Breakdown

1. GEO Selection:  
Mexico, located in the southern part of North America, is one of the largest countries in Latin America. The official language is Mexican Spanish, but there are also many local languages spoken in certain regions. The currency is the Mexican Peso, and the population is around 130 million. Most people live in cities, with Mexico City (the capital), Guadalajara, Puebla, and Tijuana being the most prominent.
The average salary in Mexico is $630, placing it in the Tier-2 or even Tier-3 category. Gambling is particularly appealing here because slot machines are banned, and Mexicans are known for their love of risk-taking and difficulty saying "no." Other cultural traits that work in favor of affiliate marketers include their relaxed, pleasure-seeking lifestyle, emotional nature, and, in some cases, lower levels of education.  

2. Traffic Source:  
High-speed internet is widespread, so there are no issues with running video creatives. Social media users in Mexico exceed 100 million, with Facebook being the most popular platform, boasting around 90 million users. This is why we chose Facebook as our placement \- the audience here is ready to spend and is highly receptive.

3. Creative Selection:  
Emotionally impactful video creatives work best. The approach to creating creatives here is similar to the American market: bright, eye-catching messages about bonuses, discounts, sales, and promotions. 
Visuals associated with luck, such as slot machines or wheels of fortune, also perform well. If the ad targets locals, it should be in Spanish. Creatives featuring attractive women playing slots also convert well.
