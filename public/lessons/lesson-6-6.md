# What Creatives and Promo Materials to Use

The creative should be tied together in design and message with all stages of the funnel—the app, landing page, and pre-landing.

***Popular working approaches:***

* A video where the hero of the story got rich playing at a casino and made it into the news.  
* A video where a person plays slots, wins, and shows a powerful burst of emotions.  
* Static images with money, bonus offers.  
* Videos showcasing the beautiful life that awaits a person if they win at the casino.

For example, one possible approach for Tier-3: an ordinary low-income person found a way to earn money from home, beat the casino, made it into the news, and now can fulfill their dreams.  
For Tier-1, it’s important to show emotions, drive, and the idea that a person can relax and have a good time at this casino.

The Start of the Creative is Crucial  
The beginning of the creative is extremely important. It determines whether the viewer will be interested and watch until the end. You can use elements like the country’s flag, mentions of local currency (e.g., on a wheel), or showcase slot games.  

### Static Images

Static images are optimal for GEOs with low internet speeds. However, don’t forget FB\* restrictions: at least 20% of the image area must be occupied by text. Otherwise, the ad may be rejected or have limited reach.  
Here’s an example of a poorly made static creative:

* Low quality.  
* Features a celebrity, which could lead to a ban.  
* Contains a misleading text.

Note: Using celebrities in creatives should be done with extreme caution. Always check with your affiliate manager to see if it’s allowed. If you use a celebrity to promote a casino, they will likely find out eventually, which could lead to lawsuits and legal issues.

### Video Creatives

If you choose a video creative approach:

* Keep the video concise—no longer than 15-20 seconds.  
* Place the main trigger within the first 10 seconds.  
* Use upbeat, energetic music.

Additionally, you can show how the winnings are deposited into a bank account. To build trust, use the interface of a real bank.

### Avoiding Direct Copies from Spy Tools

It’s not advisable to copy creatives from spy tools exactly as they are. Competitors may have had specific conditions or situations that made those creatives work. There’s no guarantee they’ll work a second time.  
If you use a successful creative from a spy tool as a base, you can make it unique by:

* Speeding up the video by 1-2 seconds.  
* Changing the music or audio track.  
* Adjusting the image resolution.  
* Rewriting the text and changing the font.  
* Applying filters or color correction.  
* Cleaning the metadata.

In this article, we’ve discussed techniques and free tools that effectively uniqueize creatives and clean metadata.

### Finding Source Materials

You can search for source materials on video platforms like YouTube. For editing, use video editors such as Sony Vegas, Filmora, or similar tools.

### Pre-Landing Pages

If the funnel is set up so that a potential player moves from the creative to a pre-landing page, this intermediary step should be designed to warm up the audience and address their pain points. The client should feel that this casino is the most reliable, exciting, and fair, and that they should start playing there as soon as possible.

The pre-landing page can be made as aggressive as needed—thanks to a good cloaker, moderators won’t see it. Sensationalism works well on pre-landing pages, tapping into triggers like curiosity and excitement.

For example, you can create a pre-landing page that mimics the design of a popular news website in the target GEO. You can customize the text, images, and include links to the offer or landing page.

**Features of Facebook\* Moderation: How to Pass**

Moderation blocks ads for aggressive texts, creatives that violate the rules, and user complaints about the ad. Facebook\* has a certain (and unofficial) list of stop words that can lead to bans. For example, experienced affiliate marketers recommend avoiding direct mentions of casinos or income figures in creatives. Instead, use hints, associations, or vague references so that people understand, but the moderation bots don’t.

Some webmasters claim that video creatives pass moderation more easily, but this depends on how the video is structured. Additionally, apps published in official stores enjoy higher trust from FB\*.  
Facebook’s\* neural networks carefully check all creatives for uniqueness. That’s why you shouldn’t copy competitors’ creatives exactly.  

### Facebook’s\* Moderation Storms

Facebook’s\* automatic moderation sometimes experiences so-called "storms"—periods of global bans that even affect well-warmed accounts. During these times, you need to have top-tier farmed accounts on hand, though they can be expensive. FB\* also has waves of ZRD (document verification requests)—sometimes they come in large numbers, and then the situation eases up.  

### How to Increase Trust

The more trusted your ad account is, the easier it is to pass moderation. It’s advisable to fully fill out and verify your Business Manager. Triggers for FB\* include high activity in the account, auto-registered accounts, and poorly farmed accounts.  
The optimal activity when running traffic is:

* 1 ad campaign,  
* 1 ad set,  
* 1 ad.

If traffic is being run over a long period, after such a campaign, you should also limit activity and avoid rushing to create new ad sets and ads.  

### Warming Up Accounts

Moderation often bans new accounts from which an affiliate marketer starts running ads and creating Business Managers. You need to warm up the account and Fan Page, even if it was purchased from a store and claimed to be pre-farmed.
