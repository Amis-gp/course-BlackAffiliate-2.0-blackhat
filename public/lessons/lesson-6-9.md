Example of setting up a Facebook ad campaign. To configure everything successfully, you need to prepare a few things in advance:

1. Set up FB Pixel Conversion API.

2. Create or purchase a Fan Page, design it for the offer you plan to run traffic to, and connect it to the required ad account.

3. Create or order ad creatives, prepare ad copy. If the creative is taken from a spy service, make it unique if necessary.

4. Create a PWA for your offer, purchase a domain and connect it (with SSL), work on the design, set up push notifications. Add Pixel ID and Token to the PWA.

5. Test the PWA on your own smartphone to make sure everything works correctly.

6. Set up the campaign in Voluum / Keitaro tracker. Connect the PWA to the tracker (go to the Traffic Source section).

7. Test the link from the tracker.

8. Set up the campaign, connect the pixel, fan page, upload the creative (if it's a video, also prepare a unique thumbnail), and add the active tracker link for the desired offer.

1 Ad campaign = 1 offer
