## Offer Selection

Based on the recommendation from manager Emil for drive traffic in Mexico, the Prostanorm Forte offer from the prostatitis remedy category was chosen.

## Pre-Landing

We didn’t have to spend much time or money testing approaches because the folks at LuckyOnline provide ready-made pre-landings from their media buying, already tested in native ads. So, we took two pre-landings with a medical news approach and adapted them for FB. In the end, the following pre-landing showed the best results:

## Creatives

Since we’d already worked with the prostatitis category in Mexico, we didn’t need to test tons of creatives. We immediately used creatives that had proven effective for prostatitis in LatAm. Here are some of them:

This approach pours well, and if rejections happen, they pop up within a day at most. Sure, these creatives have a lower CR, but thanks to the cheap click price, the cost per lead stays super sweet.

## Ad Campaign Setup

Based on experience, we went straight for the M40+ audience. Knowing that auto-placements can dump some traffic into the void, we stuck to proven placements only: FB News Feed, FB Video Feed, FB Stories, IG Stories, IG Feed.

**Pouring Scheme**: Used a 1:1:1 setup on accounts with a $50 limit. Always applied automated rules to pause expensive ad sets when they overspin.

**Bidding Strategy: Cost per Result**

Bids were set targeting a 10% ROI, but in reality, the cost per lead is always lower than the bid you set—sometimes even several times lower. Since scaling was done by increasing the number of launched ad sets, campaign budgets weren’t raised.
