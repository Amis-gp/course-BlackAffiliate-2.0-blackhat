# Drive traffic from Facebook to Nutra in 2025

**Nutra — one of the most stable and profitable verticals in arbitrage.** Supplements, cosmetics, health products — all of these have been sold and will continue to be sold at all times and in every corner of the world. People want to be slim, young, energetic, and they’re waiting for that “magic pill” that will do everything for them. That’s why this vertical consistently brings in profit — the question is how to approach it correctly to avoid losing everything at once.

**In 2025, millions are still circulating in nutra, but competition is growing, moderation is tightening, and old approaches lead to bans.** In this guide, we’ll break down which offers are currently performing well, why white-label brands have become a hyped topic, and how to work with revshare and upsells.

**The key focus in nutra right now is repeat purchases.** If in gambling you can still work with the approach of driving a user to a casino where they either lose money or win and then leave, in nutra, the client needs to come back for the next package.

**In 2025, the main metrics in nutra are LTV (Lifetime Value) and AOV (Average Order Value).**

**Unlike gambling, where profit often depends on chance, in nutra it’s crucial to build a system that encourages repeat purchases and client retention.** This requires a well-structured sales funnel and long-term relationships with clients — in other words, traditional marketing tools that many arbitrageurs are not very familiar with.

**In reality, not every arbitrageur knows how much they’re earning on upsells, even though this is one of the most important factors.** For example, if you’re working with affiliate networks like ClickBank or BayGood, you should be aware of how often buyers return and how much they spend on repeat purchases. If a client buys a cream for $40 once and then spends $200 later — you’re in profit. In gambling, everything is built on repeat deposits; in nutra, it’s about rebills and client returns.

**Our American colleagues constantly monitor upsells — this gives them a clear picture of campaign effectiveness.** It’s time to take a page from their book. In Europe, the economics of offers is also largely based on repeat purchases — this is where all Tier-1 traffic is shifting.

## Gray and White Nutra

**Gray nutra includes weight loss products, enhancers, and miracle pills for all ailments with questionable effects.** They’re easy to spot by their repetitive landing pages with exaggerated promises. Classic gray nutra consists of SS and COD offers, where the client submits a request, and a call center closes the sale. In such offers, the average order value is $20–40, but the conversion rates are decent. The downside is frequent refusals, blocks, and damaged reputation.

**Working in the “gray” zone can be profitable from a business perspective, but in the long term, it leads to market degradation.** Cheap packaging, lack of certification, aggressive marketing at the expense of quality — all of this harms the reputation. Buyers are becoming more discerning, and outright bad products simply stop being purchased.

**Fake reviews, shock content, aggressive rebills, high chargebacks — these are also part of gray schemes in nutra.** They’re still used — that’s a fact. Creatives like “We cure cancer\!” or “Caution, causes rapid weight loss\!” drive traffic from desperate people, but they don’t last long.

**If a client is disappointed, they won’t return for a second purchase.** That’s why it’s important to think about reputation, ratings on marketplaces, and seeding among bloggers. All of these are elements of brand marketing. Ideally, to successfully manage offers, you need a product manager who takes into account the product composition, funnel logic, and reputation management. The business should not just react to the market but shape it through high-quality offers and long-term strategies. Practically all of the above is unavailable or impossible in gray nutra.

**White-label products mainly refer to so-called supplements: vitamins, microelements, nootropics, and other additives with proven effectiveness.** They are sold legally and meet quality standards. White nutra can even be promoted through picky platforms like Facebook and Google. An example is Onnit, a brand that sells nootropics and sports nutrition. The average order value is $70–120, but the traffic requirements are strict.

**White-label brands don’t aim for short-term deceptive schemes; they work with legitimate products and build their marketing to retain clients.** White-label brands pay more because they focus on the long term. They invest in the aforementioned LTV rather than one-time sales. Plus, they have fewer returns and chargebacks. They are interested in long-term profits — their goal isn’t to sell a product and forget about it. They want the buyer to return, make a repeat order, and recommend the product to friends.

**What’s the challenge of working with white nutra for an arbitrageur?** The thing is, such brands demand honesty and genuinely high-quality creatives. Everything needs to be on point. No “clever tricks,” fake reviews, or exaggerated promises. White-label brands often set strict conditions for partners, and if you start slipping on quality or dipping into gray schemes, you’ll end up on a blacklist.

## Customizing Creatives for White Nutra

**Many arbitrageurs create landing pages only for themselves without thinking about the users — that’s why they don’t convert.** Build a funnel that guides the user toward conversion. If you’re working with push notifications, a pre-lander, at the very least, will help bypass moderation and filter traffic.

**Use a pre-lander as a powerful warm-up tool to dispel doubts, provide social proof, and spark interest.** Generic templates in nutra don’t work, and it’s long past time to move away from overused scam schemes that play on the audience’s pain points, feature fake expert opinions, and include reviews from a “real” person who has supposedly already solved their problem.

**So, what works:**

* Honest landing pages without fakes;  
* Widgets with timers;  
* Promo codes, limited offers, and discounts (these can boost conversions by 15–20%);  
* Simplified order forms;  
* Simple and emotional creatives: before/after photos — a classic that’s still alive;  
* Loading speed — no more than 2 seconds.

**It’s important to remember: one offer \= one pre-lander.**

It’s also crucial to consider the final touchpoint — the landing page itself. A good landing page is “packaged” with a unique selling proposition (USP). The structure should be well-thought-out, the text clear, and the images trustworthy. Keep in mind that customizing for the audience boosts CR, while false promises lower LTV, even if they convert initially.

## Revshare as the New Standard of the Future

**White-label brands love working with revshare — it allows them to optimize costs and retain clients longer.** In turn, by working on a revshare model, you earn a percentage of the order value rather than a one-time payout. If a client makes multiple purchases, you earn more. However, this depends on the product you’re promoting and the client’s stage in the funnel.

Many affiliate networks, like Baigood and ClickBank, operate on revshare. In the CIS, such models are less common, but in the US, this is already the standard. Some advertisers even operate at a loss initially to build a client base and then profit from repeat orders.

**Arbitrageurs are used to quick profits: pour traffic, get paid.** This creates a dependency on dopamine-driven cycles, so long-term monetization models like RevShare don’t appeal to everyone. However, from a strategic perspective, a percentage of sales brings more revenue over time than a fixed CPA. In gaming, this works due to high repeat monetization, and in nutra, this model is viable if:

* the product has a high LTV;  
* the offer is structured as a subscription model;  
* the product motivates repeat purchases.

**When a client demands a refund because the product didn’t meet expectations (chargeback) — that’s unfortunate.** If you’re earning a percentage of the order, it’s critical that the product actually works and sells, meaning you’re directly invested in its quality. Otherwise, you’ll face more returns than sales, which is a straight path to losses.

## Issues with Online Payments and Regional Adaptation

**In nutra, it’s essential to adapt payment methods to the audience — for example, in the US, people are all for cashless, while in Mexico, Colombia, and the CIS, it’s the opposite.** Moreover, a bank might decline a payment if it suspects something fishy (e.g., mass payments to one account), detects an international transaction, or simply decides “not today.” Adaptation is a must. Seek reliable payment systems, monitor card limits (banks may block large transactions), and split payments if a client orders multiple items at once.

## Why Old-School Schemes No Longer Work

**Since CPA models in nutra are gradually fading into the background and more people are shifting to a percentage of LTV, the quality of traffic has a maximum impact on results.** So, it all boils down to proper warm-up and working with the user.

**If you still think you can jump into a spy tool, find someone else’s funnel, tweak the creative a bit, and hit the jackpot — forget it.** This approach has been dead for over a year. The market is actively evolving, and nutra now demands more complex solutions. Today, funnels and copywriting rule. This isn’t just a basic auto-funnel thrown together on the fly, but a well-crafted scenario for client interaction:

* different stages,  
* audience segmentation,  
* targeting for warm/cold audiences,  
* effective retargeting chains.

**In 2025, copywriting is your everything.** A truly powerful text isn’t just a headline like “Grab your bonus now\!” but a deep psychological trigger that seals the deal with the user.

**Nutra is a vertical not for the lazy, but the problem is that everyone copies each other, and the same scheme keeps circling around.** They take a VSL → translate it into text → create a new one → pour traffic → wait for a miracle. In other words, there are no unique solutions: few people actually test new approaches, come up with their own twists, or build custom funnels.

## New Products and Adaptation of Approaches

**Every year, the nutra market evolves, introducing new offers that are tested using old schemes:**

* Initially, traffic is poured into proven formats (pushes, Facebook);  
* Then, landing pages and creatives are adapted to the offer;  
* Packaging is refined if the CR is low.

In the CIS, there’s a common practice of copying Western trends. It’s believed that anything that worked in the US a year ago will start hyping in Russia six months later.

**Here’s an insight: currently entering the market are probiotics, “gummies” for stress relief and smoking cessation, CBD products, patches, and oils with fast-acting effects — users want to feel results immediately, not after weeks of use.** Note that it’s crucial to monitor changes in regulations, as attitudes toward CBD products can vary significantly across countries.

**Currently on the rise:**

* Supplements for women’s health (anything related to hormonal balance, menstrual cycles, PMS);  
* Potency enhancers (everywhere except Muslim countries);  
* Sleep and stress-relief formulas — combinations of magnesium, L-theanine, melatonin, and CBD (USA, Canada, UK, but with strict moderation);  
* Biohacking products (adaptogens, nootropics, neuroactive blends);  
* Anti-aging supplements — collagen, resveratrol, next-generation omega-3 (Tier-1, Europe);  
* Nutra 18+ — women’s and men’s aphrodisiacs, lubricants based on natural ingredients;  
* Products for fitness enthusiasts, diabetics, and keto dieters — this niche is growing due to the trend toward a healthy lifestyle.

**Facebook and Google are cutting CBD advertising, so arbitrageurs are seeking workarounds through TikTok, Telegram, and native ad networks.** They’re also using hybrid schemes — for example, combining nutra and CBD, positioning the product as a comprehensive solution for health and relaxation. Additionally, combos with nootropics and adaptogens are being actively tested, especially targeting Gen Z audiences looking for “smart” supplements to boost productivity and energy.

**Another major trend is the rise of top local brands.** Many users are increasingly preferring products made by local manufacturers.

## The Future of Nutra — Evolution Toward Whitelabeling

Nutra remains a top vertical, but approaches are changing. The future of this vertical lies in new platforms, organic marketing, and high-quality content. The key is to monitor updates to advertising policies, adapt to platforms, and continuously test new niches.

**The main question now is how to build a sustainable model that generates income over the long term.**

Companies will increasingly focus on online sales through platforms like Amazon, TikTok Shop, Shopify, Walmart Marketplace, and Temu. This is particularly relevant for white-label nutra brands aiming for longevity and trust-building.

**Cash-on-delivery is gradually fading into the past, with people, especially younger audiences, opting for online payments more often.**

**GEO also plays a role: Tier-1 offers higher AOV but is harder to target, while Tier-3 provides cheaper leads but lower LTV.**

**Subscribe to popular international nutra communities on Reddit, Quora, and Facebook — you can track trends months ahead of when they hit the public.**

Facebook still works, but the rules of the game are shifting. Prohibited creatives with overpromises and Photoshop no longer pass muster. Instead:

* Native formats (posts styled as “polls” or “discussions”);  
* Ad testing with GPT creatives \+ A/B testing of headlines;  
* Video ad scripts instead of static banners;  
* Cross-promotion: nutra combos with other niches (e.g., wellness \+ beauty).

**The takeaway is clear — if you want to genuinely profit from nutra in 2025, forget about “quick money.”** Focus on honing your marketing, copywriting, and funnels. Those who realize this will rise to the top; those who don’t will stay at the bottom with copy-paste schemes.
