### **Cloaking: The Art of Stealthy Traffic** 

Alright, let’s talk about cloaking — one of the most powerful tools in the world of traffic arbitrage. Now, before we dive into the technical stuff, let’s break it down in simple terms.

Cloaking is a method used to show different content to different users based on certain parameters, typically their IP address, user agent, or even the traffic source. In other words, you can show Facebook bots or moderators one page (called a White page), while showing your real target audience (the buyers) a completely different page — your offer.

It’s like playing a little game of hide-and-seek with Facebook's moderation system. You want to make sure that while Facebook’s algorithms or human moderators are reviewing your page, they see something entirely harmless and compliant with their policies. But once the real users (your target audience) arrive, they’ll see your affiliate offer, which is what you’re actually promoting.

So, how do we make this happen using Keitaro, IP bots, and user agents? Let’s break it down step by step.

### **1\. Keitaro Tracker: Your Traffic Control Center**

Keitaro is an amazing tracking tool used in affiliate marketing, and it gives us the ability to do some cool stuff with traffic. It allows us to set parameters for traffic redirection — meaning we can control where the traffic goes based on specific conditions, like:

* IP address: Where the traffic is coming from.  
* User agent: The type of device or browser a user is using.  
* Traffic source: Where the traffic is coming from (Facebook, Google, etc.).

The beauty of Keitaro is that it helps us identify bot traffic and moderators and route it to a White page, while real users who are likely to convert get sent directly to our offer page.

### **2\. BOTS and Moderators: The Fake Traffic Trick** 

Let’s be real: Facebook bots and human moderators aren’t your friends. They're there to look for anything that might break Facebook's rules. If they see an offer that doesn’t meet their standards, BAM, you get banned.

So, to play the game smarter, we need to send them a harmless page that doesn’t raise any red flags. This is the White page. It’s a page with content that Facebook’s bots or moderators will find totally acceptable, like a basic informational page or something that doesn’t mention any gray-area topics (like gambling or adult content).

But here’s the catch — the real users, the ones who actually want to convert and click on your offer, won’t see this White page. Instead, they’re redirected to your actual offer. So while Facebook’s bots are content, your real audience is getting a clear shot at the product or service you’re promoting.

### **3\. How Do We Know It’s Working?** 

We’ve got a cool setup to make sure everything’s running smoothly:

* IP bot list: We maintain a database of around 30k IPs of bots and Facebook moderators. So, when we get traffic, Keitaro can check if the user is coming from one of those IPs and immediately redirect them to the White page.

* User agents: We also use user agents, which tell us what browser or device the user is on. If it’s a bot or moderator, the user agent will give us the clue, and they get sent to the White page. But real users with genuine traffic are sent straight to the offer page.

Cloaking is a useful tool and definitely something you should be using, but unfortunately, it doesn’t guarantee that your ads or account won’t get banned.
