So, "Affiliate networks", or "CPA networks" are the platforms that connect large companies with each other.

The next term is "hold" or "hold time". Hold time is the time for which Affiliate network delays payment to check the traffic and to verify the completed action. Usually the hold time is from 7 days and in some networks even up to 60 days. What happens during the hold period? During the hold period your money is already credited to you, but it is not paid out to you yet because the advertiser, i.e. the company you are working with, has to make sure that you have done everything correctly.
